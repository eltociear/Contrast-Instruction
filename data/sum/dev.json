        "question": "This is the incredible moment a man narrowly missed being burnt alive by a massive fireball which erupted from the pavement . Father-of-two shiraz nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after the 15-foot flames shot out of the manhole just seconds after he had walked over it in a busy street in the west midlands . The 36-year-old had been on his way to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him . Flames as high as 15ft tall erupted from a manhole in the west midlands just moments after a pedestrian had walked over it . Shiraz nawaz , 36 , said he felt lucky to be alive after he narrowly missed being burnt by flames shooting out of the manhole . As he turned around he noticed the charred ground and watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole . The smoke was followed by a huge blast of flame which shot out 15-foot of the ground on the pedestrian walkway . Further bursts of flame and thick black plumes of smoke were to follow . Despite his shock , the building contractor was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident . ' Had it literally been a few seconds earlier i would have been walking right over it , ' said a shaken mr shiraz . Mr nawaz said he had been walking to his local takeaway when he heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed the blackened cover . As he watched on in shock , thick black smoke began to escape from the manhole in the busy street in shirley , solihull . ' I 'm so lucky i did n't get burned . I think i used up one of my lives right there . ' I 've never seen anything like it , and i have been in the building trade . ' Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident , thanks to mr shiraz who had evacuated the nearby takeaway . The former gas engineer told the staff to turn off the gas supply and also rang the fire service after the incident in the busy stratford road , shirley , solihull . Firefighters extinguished the blaze , which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box - which distributes electricity - below the manhole . Neighbouring properties had to be evacuated and many others lost power for several hours as crews tackled the electrical fire which was thought to have started accidentally . Shiraz , who now fits kitchens and bathrooms , said : ' to think that i had just walked over that . ' The flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times . The smoke was followed by a quick blast of flame which shot out of the manhole on the pedestrian walkway . Flames shot up to a startling 15-foot high and could be reaching the top of the nearby shop and take away fronts . ' I 'm a building contractor so i knew that when i heard the noises it was something to do with electrics . It was like a buzzing . ' I knew what it was but i did n't expect flames to come shooting out straight away or anything like that . Shiraz was walking from his home to the dixie chicken shop around the corner from his home when he saw the flames at around 7pm on monday . ' I got my phone out because i heard the actual noise and i think i saw a flash , ' he said . ' I think i managed to get it on film just as the first real flames came up . ' It looked like it was coming from a manhole cover . It was quite shocking . ' I told the guys in the shop to switch off the gas and get everyone out . I told them to stop any unassuming person from walking down the road while i stayed on the other side . Flames were followed by more plumes of dark smoke continued to billow up out of the charred ground reaching several feet high . Miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident after shiraz evacuated the nearby takeaway , told them to turn off their gas supply , and called the fire service . ' The guy in the shop grabbed me a couple of burgers after everything , so i guess it had a happy ending . ' A spokesman for west midlands fire service said : ' we had a number of calls about about it - probably five or six , maybe a couple more . ' It involved a fire in an underground electrical link box . The electrical supply was isolated by western power . ' Power was isolated to surrounding homes and premises for four hours . ' Three people were evacuated from one of the properties . ' We used a co2 extinguisher and a hose real with foam , because it was an electrical fire . It was accidental . ' Western power distribution workers were later seen repairing the man hole cover in shirley , solihull . The area had been evacuated and blocked off as western power distribution employees worked to fix the underground link box . Incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident and quick-thinking shiraz managed to grab his phone in time to take a film of the astonishing flames .",

        "question": "( cnn ) two cnn heroes are among the earthquake survivors in kathmandu , nepal . And they are struggling in the aftermath . Anuradha koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls . While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed , all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks , followed by a second earthquake on may 12 . The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry . `` we are suffering with rain , strong wind . The fear is not gone from us . It is very , very hard , `` said koirala , the founder of the nonprofit maiti nepal and the 2010 cnn hero of the year . The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera . Koirala 's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food . Still , she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster . `` these girls are most vulnerable , because now people will target them , `` koirala said . `` they could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse . Maybe rape , maybe they will be trafficked , anything . ... if i get more support i will take as many as i can . `` About five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . Home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , `` koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . `` Koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , `` koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . I was not afraid that i was going to be killed . I was afraid about what is going to happen next . `` Another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . They are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . But mentally , we are , `` said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . Basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , `` basnet said . `` we are really scared . `` They also do n't have much water or food , basnet says . But she is trying to stay positive . `` i think for the time being , whatever we have , we should be happy , you know ? Because at least we have our life , `` she said . `` ( my kids ) all are safe . That 's the most important thing for me . `` Basnet 's `` butterfly home `` -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake . Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october . Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 hero of the year . `` when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , `` she said . `` i have to restart again . `` Still , basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid . To that end , several cnn heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in nepal . Jake wood 's disaster relief organization , team rubicon , has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in kathmandu . The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city . Six canine-firefighter search teams from the united states also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts . The teams were trained by wilma melville 's national disaster search dog foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers , hazmat experts and doctors . Tom henderson 's shelterbox , which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies , has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families . Dr. laura stachel 's group , we care solar , sent solar suitcases to health care workers , providing them with light and power as they aid survivors . Arlene samen 's group , one heart world-wide , has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies , especially in hard-hit districts . Robin lim , a disaster response midwife who founded bumi sehat , joined samen in kathmandu to help the mothers . Doc hendley 's nonprofit , wine to water , partnered with appalachian state university in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in nepal . The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly .",

        "question": "John helm was commentating on bradford city â s game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day . Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze . It was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember . Approaching the 30th anniversary of the bradford city fire , it was inevitable i would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match i was commentating on for yorkshire television . What i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin fletcher has done with his book fifty-six , the story of the bradford fire . The tragic fire at bradford city 's valley parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind â any bitterness would be understandable â but from everything i have been told there isn â t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately . On the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started . Detective inspector raymond falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire . This corroborates what i was told at the time by the coroner . He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from australia , but his name was never revealed . Without making allegations against the club â s chairman at the time stafford heginbotham , there is inference by implication in the book â with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased heginbotham . As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson . I find it abhorrent that stafford heginbotham â s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives . There isn â t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy . It should also never be forgotten that heginbotham twice saved bradford city from extinction . As son james said to me : â he put that club above everything else , including family and business . â a memorial at valley parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine . I can not bear to watch the footage . If i hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded i have to leave the room . Many of the 54 bradford and two lincoln fans who lost their lives , choked to death with inhalation of fumes . The smell was of acrid tar . As a bradfordian myself i knew many of those fleeing for their lives , as i attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional . Thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .",

        "question": "Apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage . To address these issues , the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts . At least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm 's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops . Fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . These include one for an ios battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for ios software power systems engineer ( pictured right ) . The job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer . In particular , the ios software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends . ' Apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . All-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . Talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . Workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . Watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . Power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . Charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . Apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . As the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . Apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . These times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . Apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . However , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . Boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . Battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . Alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . Earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . The sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . A number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . Atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas .

Apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . Apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . The microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . By effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . Plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . Earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . Atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .",

        "question": "Armstrong , 26 , pleaded guilty of trying to bring a stun gun , a baton and knuckle dusters back into the uk from cyprus in his luggage ( file picture ) . A holidaymaker who jetted off to cyprus to celebrate his new job was sacked before starting after returning with a stun gun , baton and knuckle duster in his luggage . Paul armstrong , 26 , of sunderland , flew to cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an it project manager . But after a spending spree on the trip , armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch , extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage . A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to ' startle and repel ' . Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it . Judge john milford qc told newcastle crown court : ' the general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs . ' What he did was foolish . It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items . ' A stun gun is , within the legislation of this country , a firearm .

        "question": "Her neighbour â s leylandii hedge stands 40ft tall and , says audrey alexander , has left parts of her garden in deep shade . What â s more , it now seems likely to remain that way . Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size , the council has ruled they can stay . It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of mrs alexander â s family . It kicked off 35 years ago when mrs alexander â s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii . A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge ( pictured ) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour 's massive hedge . Then , 23 years ago , single mother mrs alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour jeanette robinson to trim the hedge . She claims mrs robinson refused and declared : â i would rather move than touch these trees . â the dispute rumbled on , with mrs alexander , 54 , claiming that the trees knocked Â£20,000 off the value of her property . She sensed an opportunity , however , with the passing of the high hedge act in scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases . Stirling council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay , despite claims it has knocked Â£20,000 off the value of neighbour audrey alexander 's house ( pictured ) . The situation came to a head in 2008 , when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour 's garden shed . Audrey alexander ( pictured ) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that mrs robinson can keep the hedge , although it has to be cut to 20ft . Mrs alexander said the ruling made â no difference â . The high hedge act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden . Complainants and the hedge 's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort . Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear , disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached . The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice , which orders owners to cut the hedge back , or decide not to act . The local authority can not make any orders about the roots of the hedge . She added : â the whole situation is appalling â the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight . â it â s a disgrace and i feel extremely let down . â the neighbour refused to comment . Mrs alexander â s only option is the courts which she can not afford to do . Over the years she had used the mediation services of stirling district council to try to resolve the issue . The situation came to a head in 2008 , when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell , demolishing a neighbour â s garden shed . Following the introduction of the high hedge act , stirling council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling . Dr colin watson , of scothedge , a group which demands the end of â high hedge tyranny â , said that the council â s decision was â pretty crazy â . A council spokesman said the decision was made â after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence â . Mrs alexander said her aunt , now 87 , had moved to france to enjoy â sunshine and gardening â . Ms alexander called in stirling district council to try to solve the quarrel , but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft , a height which ms alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .",

        "question": "Their chipotle lunch became a media storm . But that was just the start for hillary clinton 's most trusted aide huma abedin . And so , relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off , the notoriously low-profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in new york - with another mexican bite . The 38-year-old was spotted with her husband , disgraced former congressman anthony weiner , and two-year-old son jordan tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on saturday afternoon . Scroll down for video . Before the campaign heats up : hillary clinton 's aide huma abedin ( left ) was spotted grabbing a mexican lunch with husband anthony weiner and three-year-old son jordan at quaint tortaria in new york on saturday . Low profile : weiner ( second left ) and adebin wore baseball caps as they enjoyed their lunch with their son . Weiner had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion . Skipping chipotle : their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food mexican diner . Abedin and clinton were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an iowa chipotle this week but came under fire after staff complained abedin did not put any change in the tip jar . Chipotle does not always have tip jars . The family was pictured inside at a table , where weiner swung his new york mets baseball cap backwards while he ate . It is just a few days after abedin and clinton were spotted , sunglasses on , in an iowa branch of fast food favorite chipotle . Grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad , the pair dashed back out to the ' scooby van ' - and failed to pay a tip . This time , with her boss out of sight , abedin side-stepped chipotle and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door : tortarÃ­a . Weiner and abedin both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off union square , where tortas range from $ 7.50 to $ 11 . As well as food served at the table , customers can also buymexican fare to use at home . Weiner , a former congressman , fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over twitter . He ordered the family 's food as his wife sat with headphones in listening to a conference call . Abedin 's husband weiner is the disgraced former congressman who was caught sending explicit images to women over twitter 's private message system . The couple stayed together throughout the saga in 2011 . The family will no doubt have to ride out more storms with fierce republican campaigns against hillary . Classy : the restaurant also doubles as a bodega , selling mexican-inspired pantry staples . Keen to get going : abedin looks back as weiener brings up the rear , holding his son 's scooter and helmet in one hand . It was a quiet and relaxed day for the family as they embark on a doubtless hectic journey toward the 2016 election . Rand paul quipped on saturday that the clinton campaign will require two planes wherever they go - ' one for her entourage , and one for her baggage ' . ' I 'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering , ' paul said . Opinions were divided over whether the former secretary of state nailed her attempt to woo middle america with her tour of iowa . Not the only one with a taste for mexican : marco rubio also dipped into chipotle for lunch the other day . In a bid to win over the everyman , she met with voters and laid out her vision for a campaign to be a champion for the average american . And , of course , visited chipotle . Clinton is not the only presidential hopeful who has been seen tucking into mexican fast food on the trail as they each try to court hispanic and low-income voters . Republican hopeful marco rubio has also grabbed a chipotle lunch . Jeb bush , however , admits that is not on his to-do list - as he and his colombian wife cook ' authentic ' mexican food at home .",

Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little , but they can also increase travel sickness , research has found . The research was carried out by michael sivak and brandon schoettle from the university of michigan transportation research institute . They asked more than 3,200 adults across the us , india , china , japan , great britain and australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle . More than a third of americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness , including reading , texting , watching movies or television , playing games or working . More than half of indians , 40 per cent of chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in japan , great britain and australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities . The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey .

        "question": "Twitter suspended more than 10,000 accounts linked to islamic state militants and their supporters in a single 24-hour period in a fresh crackdown on those ' tweeting violent threats ' . Jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week , most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the middle east . Now , after questions were asked about what led to the largest ever one-off cull of isis-affiliated accounts , twitter has confirmed that its purge was prompted because they were being used by tech-savvy jihadis to issue threats of violence . Online savvy : jihad-watchers noticed thousands of accounts vanishing from the social network last week , most of them claiming to be linked to the extremists currently terrorising vast swathes of the middle east . Twitter does not publish data related to the accounts it suspends , but ndtv gadgets reported that the social network 's so-called ' violations department ' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by isis militants or supporters of the terror group on april 2 . Speaking on condition of anonymity amid fears for his safety , the representative said the cull was prompted in part by the ' large number of reports ' received by online activists and members of the public . Without doubt this is a reference to the ' operation anti-isis ' campaign launched by the online ' hacktavist ' collective anonymous , who encouraged members to find and expose thousands of accounts connected with isis and report them to twitter authorities en masse . While the social network says it remains committed to the platform being used as a symbol of free speech , it says it will not tolerate accounts tweeting sickening messages promoting violence . Isis - the largest and wealthiest terrorist organisation in history - has long used social media to groom and enlist new recruits , spread sickening propaganda , and glorify rape and massacre . Sick : twitter 's so-called ' violations department ' suspended approximately 10,000 accounts used by the isis militants themselves ( pictured ) or by supporters of the terror group , on april 2 . Last month it was revealed that web-savvy militants fighting for isis could control as many as 90,000 twitter accounts worldwide , allowing them to spread their sickening propaganda with ease . The terror group is able to ' exert an outsized impact on how the world perceives it ' because of its shrewd use of social media and sheer number of online followers , terror experts have concluded . Recommendations in the report by the washington-based brookings institute report include governments and social media companies working together to find new ways to tackle the problem of pro-isis accounts spreading horrific murder videos and images and jihadist rhetoric . While twitter has had success in suspending the accounts , they are effectively playing an exasperating game of whack-a-mole as banned users almost-immediately set up another account . They then encourage isis sympathisers who have not yet been banned to share the details of their new profile and within a matter of hours can have thousands of people once again reading their messages of hate .",

        "question": "The european union will today accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . Brussels will say that google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include youtube and the google+ social network . In one of the most high-profile competition cases of recent years , europe could fine google more than Â£4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in europe to the perceived dominance of us tech companies . Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market . The european union will accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . But the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the american search giant â means google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to brussels . Margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules , according to the financial times . Google 's competitors , including the computer giant microsoft and sites such as travel booking firm expedia and tripadvisor , claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field . And in a further blow to google , the eu is also expected to probe google 's operating system for android smartphones . The investigation will centre on whether google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps , such as youtube . Google has previously rejected the allegations , and insisted that android is an open platform that is distributed for free . Margrethe vestager , the eu 's competition commissioner , will today serve google with a formal charge sheet . After charges are issued , google will have ten weeks to reply to brussels , according to the financial times . They will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing . The investigation into google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms . Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case . Most recently , just over a year ago , it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website . However europe initially accepted that deal , only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions . Vestager , europe 's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit danish political drama series borgen , took over the job in november and vowed to take google on . Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the eu 's decade-long battle with microsoft , which ultimately cost the company Â£1.6 billion in fines . If google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by brussels , the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed Â£4 billion - about 10 per cent of google 's most recent annual revenue . The move will stop short of previous threats that the eu executive could consider breaking up google to separate its business from the search engine . Google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years . But the latest move by the eu marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing . The search engine is far more dominant in europe than it is in the united states â where rivals like microsoft 's bing enjoy a share of the market . And there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of google from many countries in the eu . In fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals . More than two dozen european organisations have filed antitrust complaints against google . Many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in germany . They have previously called on the european regulator to force the american search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps , shopping and travel services . And in france , lawyers have this week called on google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites â but google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam . Google and the eu commission declined to comment last night . Vestager 's department is also looking into the tax affairs of amazon , starbucks , fiat and apple . In a recent sunday times article she said big companies should pay more as they ' are part of our society . ' Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the eu 's decade-long battle with microsoft .",
        "response_j": "Brussels will say that google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services , which include youtube and the google + social network . Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market . The european union will accuse google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market .",
        "response_k": "Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in europe 's search engine market . Eu could fine google more than # 4 billion amid a wave of political opposition in europe to the perceived dominance of us tech companies . The result of a five-year investigation into the american search giant -- means google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to brussels ."

        "question": "Apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage . To address these issues , the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts . At least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm 's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops . Fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple 's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries . These include one for an ios battery life software engineer ( pictured left ) and another for ios software power systems engineer ( pictured right ) . The job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer . In particular , the ios software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate ' will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues , modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system , and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends . ' Apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . All-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . Talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . Workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . Watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . Power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . Charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . Apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . As the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . Apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . These times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . Apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . However , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . Boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . Battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . Alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . Earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . The sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . A number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . Atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' Apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . Apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . Apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . Apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . The microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . By effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . Plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . Earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . Atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .",

        "question": "Saudi prince alwaleed bin talal has pledged to give 100 bentleys to saudi pilots who took part in air strikes against rebels advancing in yemen . A saudi prince has promised to give a free bentley to every pilot involved in the yemen air strikes , as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop . Saudi arabian forces launched air strikes on yemen a month ago to stop advances from the shiite houthi rebels , who are allied with iran and previously overthrew the saudi-backed government . Prince alwaleed bin talal , the saudi king abdullah 's nephew , has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in riyadh , the saudi arabian capital , a free bentley . Prince talal , who owns $ 300 million stake in twitter , apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted , the international business times reported . He wrote : ' to recognise the one hundred participating saudi pilots i am pleased to present them with 100 bentley cars , ' on tuesday the saudis said the bombing raids , which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480 , had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead . But the raids appeared to have resumed by wednesday , with fighting taking place in taez . Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed . Bin talal , 60 , is the grandson of saudi arabia 's founder ibn saud and one of the richest men ion the world . He has an estimated fortune of $ 23 billion and investments in london 's savoy hotel , apple , citigroup and news corp . He has previously gifted 25 bentleys to members of a saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world 's richest . Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by saudi arabian forces . The prince , who is a billionaire , has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a bentley . His comments were met with criticism on twitter , as well as supporters of those in yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes . Saudi forces began its military campaign , called operation decisive storm , on march 26 . They were launched to stop the advancement of shiite houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the saudi-backed government and ousted president abed rabbo mansour hadi . Saudi arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of sanaa would stop on tuesday , but they appeared to resume again on wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in yemen . After four weeks hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital sanai . The saudis announced yesterday an end to the ' successful ' operation decisive storm and that they would be moving to a new operation , dubbed ' restoring hope . ' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity . However the saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of aden as well as taez . In taez , the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th armoured brigade , loyal to hadi , an army officer said . The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports .",

        "question": "Stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 , after beating fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final . Now mentor ricky wilson , his fellow celebrity judges rita ora , tom jones and will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the bbc will all have their fingers crossed for his success . Because it 's not just a hit single stevie needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts . Scroll down for video . Can this year 's the voice uk champion stevie mccrorie break the winners ' curse ? His mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . Leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer . The very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . Series one winner leanne mitchell , mentored to success in 2012 by sir tom jones , blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final . But despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts . Then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100 . Some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny o'donoghue , believe leanne did n't have the right work ethic . When asked last year about leanne 's flop , he said , ' i was told by tom jones , and by the label as well , that leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star . ' Leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . Leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . After being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . The singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . But can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? Former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . Partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . The partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . She even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' Everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . But while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . Her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . Will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . If a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . The singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . Despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . Compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited .

Despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . The glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . So can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? His debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . The scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . Stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . When asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before . ' So now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! No pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk . Here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from simon cowell 's itv show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to matt cardle and rebecca ferguson in 2010 , but simon cowell 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans . Leona lewis despite having left simon cowell 's label sycon last year , leona remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win . Jls the runners-up of the 2009 series , jls went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013 . Olly murs he came second to joe mcelderry in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as jls and co-present the x factor 's sister show xtra factor in itv2 with caroline flack . Alexandra burke after winning the 2009 series following her duet with beyonce , alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single hallelujah . James arthur before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile twitter rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series . Little mix the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , little mix have now beaten the spice girls ' chart success in america and raked up an impressive 132million vevo views . Rebecca ferguson though she came second to matt cardle in the 2010 series , rebecca has just released her third album lady sings the blues and has enjoyed steady chart success .",

        "question": "A married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to ivf . Denise and glen higgs , from braunton , devon , had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment . But using his frozen sperm , doctors successfully created eight embryos through ivf fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter mazy , born three years ago . Louise and glen higgs with daughter mazy , aged three and newborns carson alan ( left ) and carter joel ( right ) . The couple tried again using the same batch and denise gave birth to twins carter and carson last week . Former raf fireman glen said : ' medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time . ' It is crazy really - seeing as there are three-and-half years between them in age . ' Glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . He met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment . Carter joel higgs ( white top ) and carson alan higgs ( blue top ) who were born on march 24 2015 weighing 5lb 12oz and 5lb 5oz , with ivf triplet sister mazy linda higgs , aged three . Glen said : ' i had an unusual tumour growing within the testicle . After all my treatment , they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers . ' I knew then that if i ever wanted to have children i would have to go through ivf . ' I had always wanted kids and first went through the process with dee in 2010 . We got funding for the first try and got lucky when mazy was born . ' Glen , now a manager at a filter-making factory , said : ' we then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay . We ended up having eight embryos . ' We put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six . ' We were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again . We had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again . ' Amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies . ' I always wanted to have kids and am a big family man . The process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome . ' I am the happiest man ever . I have three healthy kids when i thought i would never have any . One we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift . ' What my wife and her body had to go through makes her the real hero to me . ' Glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . He met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment : carter joel higgs ( white top ) and carson alan higgs ( blue top ) . The ivf procedure involved doctors effectively ' hoovering ' the eggs from of dee 's body and injecting them with the frozen sperm . Care assistant denise , 27 , said : ' when i heard i was having twins i cried and my husband just went white . To now have triplets is simply amazing . In the uk , one in every three thousand births is to triplets . Approximately 15 per cent of ' multiples ' are born thanks to ivf . Source : twinsuk . ' We were so happy though . It has been a huge change in our lives but we have just learnt to adapt . ' Going through ivf is one of the hardest things you ever have to go through as a woman . ' The whole process is horrendous , but as we have proved it does actually work . ' There are so many injections and medication and it can be very undignified at times . I did get very emotional at times but i have no regrets at all about doing it . ' I could not be happier with what we have been left with . ' The couple have now disposed of the remaining embryos and have no plans to have any more children .",

        "question": "One in five chinese restaurants are believed to be serving shark fin soup exploiting a legal loophole allowing people to bring the meat to this country if it is for personal consumption , a charity claims . The loophole came to light after trading standards officers raided restaurant the royal china club , on baker street in central london , and confiscated illegally imported fins .

Scroll down for video . The revelations come after the royal china club , a restaurant in central london , was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth . Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup ( pictured ) on their menus as ' fish fin soup ' , or are offering it to mandarin speaking customers if they ask . More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins , often dying slow , painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off . Graham buckingham , campaign director at bite-back , told the times he was disappointed that the royal china club was not fined for their breach . He added : ' there 's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute , the fines are described as minimal . ' Charity bite-back believes as many as one in five chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption . While conducting research for a recent report , mr buckingham 's charity discovered a legal loophole allowing for 20kg of shark fin to be brought into this country if it is for personal consumption . Just one kilogram of shark fin can fetch up to Â£180 through wholesale markets .

        "question": "The name gary - once one of the most popular name in britain - is now heading for extinction . Just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows . That compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain . In 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 . All in a name : others suggest that gary lineker , left , or take that singer barlow might have put some off . Helped by the popularity of actor gary cooper , there was a surge in garys born in the us in the early 1950s . There was even a trend of girls being given the name . The name peaked in britain roughly decade later . In 1964 , it was ranked 16th most popular . Since then , there has been a fall in the number of garys . It is now among a number of once-common names that are close to dying-out completely . Fall from grace : some blame shamed pop star gary glitter , pictured , for the name 's declining popularity . There has been suggestion that football pundit lineker , or take that singer barlow might have put some off the name . But others point to britain 's most notorious gary , paedophile pop star glitter , who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls , as the reason behind the name 's fall from grace . Speaking to the sun , gary davis , from south london , said : ' gary glitter has obviously done us no favours . ' Between 1996 and 2013 , unusual names such as dexter ( there were 1,019 born in 2013 ) , jenson ( 1,055 ) and harley ( 1,275 ) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100 . Meanwhile , the country went from having no girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . Nearly 200 were born in 2013 . Other names inspired by famous faces including rihanna ( 60 born in 2013 ) , hermione ( 77 ) and paris ( 107 ) were also more popular than humble gary . Data from last year shows a surge in arabic names in the uk , with omar , ali and ibrahim all entering the boys â top 100 for the first time . For girls , maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35 , while nur is a new entry in the girls â top 100 , jumping straight to number 29 . And muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys . Sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year â s biggest riser within the girls â top 100 was maryam , while the highest new entries were nur , emilia and gracie . For baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . The highest new entry was kian . Popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . Above , harper with her brothers and father last month . Girls . Alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it â s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . Not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . It dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . Barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . Barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . Claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . Claudine along with most other once-popular âine and âeen-ending girls â names are now out of favor . Nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . But today , most parents say no to nanette . Sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . Sondra - sandra â s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . But the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . Thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name â she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet â is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . Zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . Selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . Boys . Elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . Any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . Icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . His name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . Inigo - inigo is another name that â s never ranked here , though it â s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . It â s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . Llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . But despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . Remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . But the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . Sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson â s heyday , but it hasn â t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . Waldo - where â s waldo ? He â s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . Waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .",

        "question": "A cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories . Olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . The breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk . The easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . Up for the challenge : customer glen keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . The meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons . For Â£7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate easter egg , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure . Two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar . Marshmallows and m & m 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce . He starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ' bowl ' . Mr keogh takes on the easter feast ( left ) but barely gets through before he regrets his decision ( right ) . Finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed . Mr taylor , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into black milk . He created the easter feast challenge to celebrate the gluttony of easter . Cadbury 's chocolate egg ( 291g ) : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories . Baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories . Kosher cereal from israel : 8g sugar ; 150 calories . Toffee crisp cereal : 7.2g sugar ; 150g calories . Home-made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories . Creme egg : 26.5g sugar ; 177 calories . Mini eggs : 20.5g sugar ; 148 calories . Flake : 16.7g sugar ; 171 calories .

M & ms : 13g sugar ; 140 calories . Total : 3,816 calories . Average man needs 2,500 calories per day . ' It 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ' Easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ' No one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' He said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' I want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . Although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . Sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . He said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ' After tucking straight into the crÃ¨me egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ' The cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ' Ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . My nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' The easter feast is made of half a cadbury 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from israel ; toffee crisp cereal ; home-made brownie ; creme egg ; mini eggs ; flake ; dulce de leche ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and m & m 's .

Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little , but they can also increase travel sickness , research has found . The research was carried out by michael sivak and brandon schoettle from the university of michigan transportation research institute . They asked more than 3,200 adults across the us , india , china , japan , great britain and australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle . More than a third of americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness , including reading , texting , watching movies or television , playing games or working . More than half of indians , 40 per cent of chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in japan , great britain and australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities . The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey .

        "question": "Residents living yards from the scene of the Â£60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . They also claim to have heard â drilling â noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : â my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . â but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . â but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : â it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . â career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : â we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . â i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? â former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . Kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . Mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . Where were the gang from ? Speculation over the gang â s origin has been feverish . Possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . However , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . An accomplice on the inside ? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . Furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company â s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . Loot smuggled out of the country ? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . Whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be â a doddle â . What about the â king of diamonds â ? A criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . The panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with Â£13million worth of jewellery .",

But the church of scotland yesterday hit back , saying it remains one of the country â s â largest and most robust organisations â . Miss hawksley said : â there is another person in an order in london and she is 27 and we meet to chat . You are not on your own . It is an unusual life choice , but you are not the only one making it . There are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions . â she admitted some of her friends were â a bit bewildered â , but most had been very supportive . Far from being trapped in traditional habits , miss hawksley said her order tends to dress down in t-shirts and jeans . Father christopher jamison , director of the national office for vocation of england and wales , said : â there is a gap in the market for meaning in our culture . One of the ways women may find that meaning is through religious life . â sister cathy jones , religious life vocations promoter at the office , said : â we are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago , catholic culture was at a very different place . â but the fact that more women are becoming nuns than in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner . â last year , bbc northern ireland political reporter martina purdy quit her 25-year career in journalism to become a nun . She said : â i know many people will not understand this decision . It is a decision i have not come to lightly , but it is one i make with love and great joy . â",

        "question": "Stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 , after beating fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final . Now mentor ricky wilson , his fellow celebrity judges rita ora , tom jones and will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the bbc will all have their fingers crossed for his success . Because it 's not just a hit single stevie needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts . Scroll down for video . Can this year 's the voice uk champion stevie mccrorie break the winners ' curse ? His mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . Leanne mitchell , the first ever winner of the voice uk , has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer . The very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . Series one winner leanne mitchell , mentored to success in 2012 by sir tom jones , blew everyone away with her version of whitney houston 's i would run to you in the live final . But despite much excitement surrounding her first single , she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts . Then a year later came her album , a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions , which failed to chart in the top 100 . Some , including the script frontman and former voice coach danny o'donoghue , believe leanne did n't have the right work ethic . When asked last year about leanne 's flop , he said , ' i was told by tom jones , and by the label as well , that leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star . ' Leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . Leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . After being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . The singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . But can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? Former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . Partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . The partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . She even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' Everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . But while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . Her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . Andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . Will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . If a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . The singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . Despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . Compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . Compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . Despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . The glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . So can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? His debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . The scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . Stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . When asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before . ' So now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! No pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk . Here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from simon cowell 's itv show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to matt cardle and rebecca ferguson in 2010 , but simon cowell 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans . Leona lewis despite having left simon cowell 's label sycon last year , leona remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win . Jls the runners-up of the 2009 series , jls went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013 . Olly murs he came second to joe mcelderry in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as jls and co-present the x factor 's sister show xtra factor in itv2 with caroline flack . Alexandra burke after winning the 2009 series following her duet with beyonce , alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single hallelujah . James arthur before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile twitter rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series . Little mix the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , little mix have now beaten the spice girls ' chart success in america and raked up an impressive 132million vevo views . Rebecca ferguson though she came second to matt cardle in the 2010 series , rebecca has just released her third album lady sings the blues and has enjoyed steady chart success .",

Since winning the champions league under jose mourinho in 2004 the portuguese champions have made a habit of selling on players for huge profits .

        "question": "I spoke to carl froch for an hour this week and we have talked long and hard about what he is going to do next . Needless to say , we were disappointed to see julio cesar chavez jnr lose at the weekend against andrzej fonfara . It wasn â t a result we were expecting and it also blows away the chance of froch and chavez fighting in las vegas â a fight carl wanted . Now we turn to three big fights in the next two months to see what carl does next . I have held talks with gennady golovkin â s manager and there is also the possibility of bernard hopkins , but there are three fights coming up where the winner could work for carl . Carl froch ( left ) has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may . Froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now . Froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara last week . There is the possibility of paul smith-andre ward in the pipeline , anthony dirrell versus badou jack for the wbc world title and andre dirrell â s ibf world title fight against james degale , which is the biggest bout of this trio . Anthony dirrell â s people have already been in touch with me about a froch fight in the event that he wins , but i wonder if it is big enough . A fight against degale still feels to me like the most probable , if he comes through against dirrell on may 23 . That is a huge fight , a proper 50-50 , but i fully believe he can do it . For me , from talking to carl , i think he needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return . If doesn â t come back this year , i don â t think he will . He has been a year out of the ring so let â s see . I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights . The possibility of him retiring is very high but he is still training hard . He is walking around at 12st 7lbs and in the gym four to five days a week . The guy has the hunger but it has to be for the right fight and the right money . My belief is still that it might be degale . Degale has looked sensational in camp and is improving at a brilliant rate â if he wins the title over in the us he will be in a great position . I mentioned golovkin before . When i was on the phone to carl he spent 20 minutes talking about the guy . He is a fighter that absolutely fascinates him ; it â s a fight that would get everyone talking . I am looking at it . It would have to be at 168lbs and it would be special . I wouldn â t want to be the one to find out how golovkin punches at the weight but carl has a sick mind like that . I â m not going to rule that one out . James degale ( right ) has now emerged as the most likely next opponent for froch on his return . Another option for froch could be a rematch with ward , should the american beat paul smith . After a disappointing couple of weeks it seems that my hopes to stage carl frampton-scott quigg this summer are dead in the water . We received no offers from their side and made three of our own â we offered a 50-50 split , a 60-40 in favour of the winner and also a Â£1.5m guarantee to frampton . I sent that last offer in writing to them and had no response . You ask yourself who is making these decisions ? It is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . Let â s hope they don â t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . Scott will move on and fight on july 18 . I can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . Scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . Carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . Hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team Â£1.5m to fight quigg . Anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . He is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . We are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . I saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . After the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . Watch this space . Anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .",

        "question": "One in five chinese restaurants are believed to be serving shark fin soup exploiting a legal loophole allowing people to bring the meat to this country if it is for personal consumption , a charity claims . The loophole came to light after trading standards officers raided restaurant the royal china club , on baker street in central london , and confiscated illegally imported fins . Charity bite-back , which campaigns to protect sharks , reported the eatery after jason chan , its marketing manager , boasted that it sold the soup and another dish made with ground shark teeth . Scroll down for video . The revelations come after the royal china club , a restaurant in central london , was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth . Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup ( pictured ) on their menus as ' fish fin soup ' , or are offering it to mandarin speaking customers if they ask . More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins , often dying slow , painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off . Graham buckingham , campaign director at bite-back , told the times he was disappointed that the royal china club was not fined for their breach . He added : ' there 's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute , the fines are described as minimal . ' Charity bite-back believes as many as one in five chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption . While conducting research for a recent report , mr buckingham 's charity discovered a legal loophole allowing for 20kg of shark fin to be brought into this country if it is for personal consumption . Just one kilogram of shark fin can fetch up to Â£180 through wholesale markets . He said as many as one in five chinese restaurants could be offering the dish , but many disguised it as ' fish fin soup ' or did not put it on the menu , but offered it to mandarin speaking patrons .",

        "question": "( cnn ) the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . Buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self-described reformers have been . Swath . But the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . And the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . For too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . The cancer of corruption has to be cut out . I visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . Abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . Soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . It 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . Yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . And when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . Graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . The richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . For a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . But stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . Lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . One was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . The problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . The problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . Nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . The south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . And the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . `` Westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . Failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . Previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . In 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . Few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . And soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . The government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . What is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . And the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . For buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . The victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . On the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . He ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . But he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . Buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . Now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . Get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . Buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . But they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . You can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .",

        "question": "Saudi prince alwaleed bin talal has pledged to give 100 bentleys to saudi pilots who took part in air strikes against rebels advancing in yemen . A saudi prince has promised to give a free bentley to every pilot involved in the yemen air strikes , as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop . Saudi arabian forces launched air strikes on yemen a month ago to stop advances from the shiite houthi rebels , who are allied with iran and previously overthrew the saudi-backed government . Prince alwaleed bin talal , the saudi king abdullah 's nephew , has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in riyadh , the saudi arabian capital , a free bentley . Prince talal , who owns $ 300 million stake in twitter , apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted , the international business times reported . He wrote : ' to recognise the one hundred participating saudi pilots i am pleased to present them with 100 bentley cars , ' on tuesday the saudis said the bombing raids , which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480 , had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead . But the raids appeared to have resumed by wednesday , with fighting taking place in taez . Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed . Bin talal , 60 , is the grandson of saudi arabia 's founder ibn saud and one of the richest men ion the world . He has an estimated fortune of $ 23 billion and investments in london 's savoy hotel , apple , citigroup and news corp . He has previously gifted 25 bentleys to members of a saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world 's richest . Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by saudi arabian forces . The prince , who is a billionaire , has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a bentley . His comments were met with criticism on twitter , as well as supporters of those in yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes .

They were launched to stop the advancement of shiite houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the saudi-backed government and ousted president abed rabbo mansour hadi . Saudi arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of sanaa would stop on tuesday , but they appeared to resume again on wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in yemen . After four weeks hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital sanai . The saudis announced yesterday an end to the ' successful ' operation decisive storm and that they would be moving to a new operation , dubbed ' restoring hope . ' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity . However the saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of aden as well as taez . In taez , the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th armoured brigade , loyal to hadi , an army officer said . The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports .",

        "question": "A cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut-busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories . Olly taylor , 27 , is offering his version the easter feast , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his black milk cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . The breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an easter egg , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk . The easter feast breakfast is available at the black milk cereal cafe in manchester 's northern quarter . Up for the challenge : customer glen keogh attemps the 4,000-calorie meal which has 388g of sugar . The meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons . For Â£7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate easter egg , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure . Two cereals of choice are added together with a creme egg , a handful of mini eggs , home-made chocolate brownie and a flake chocolate bar . Marshmallows and m & m 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade dulce de leche - an argentinian take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce . He starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ' bowl ' . Mr keogh takes on the easter feast ( left ) but barely gets through before he regrets his decision ( right ) . Finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed . Mr taylor , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine-dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into black milk . He created the easter feast challenge to celebrate the gluttony of easter . Cadbury 's chocolate egg ( 291g ) : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories . Baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories . Kosher cereal from israel : 8g sugar ; 150 calories . Toffee crisp cereal : 7.2g sugar ; 150g calories . Home-made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories . Creme egg : 26.5g sugar ; 177 calories . Mini eggs : 20.5g sugar ; 148 calories . Flake : 16.7g sugar ; 171 calories . Dulce de leche : 50g sugar ; 315 calories . Salted caramel sauce 10g sugar ; 300 calories . Milks : 30g sugar ; 300 calories . Marshmallows : 40g sugar ; 75 calories . M & ms : 13g sugar ; 140 calories . Total : 3,816 calories . Average man needs 2,500 calories per day . ' It 's all in the spirit of easter , ' he said . ' Easter is less about what is used to mean , and now on easter sunday people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them . ' No one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the bank holiday to see if anyone can . ' He said the initial idea for the easter feast came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in paris and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market . ' I want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said . Although his cafe may stake a claim to creating britain 's most tooth-rotting dish , mr taylor is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , special k and protein granolas used as an after-gym snack . Sweet-toothed customer glen keogh bravely attempted the challenge , opting for toffee crisp and a kosher cereal from israel as his two choices . He said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first . ' After tucking straight into the crÃ¨me egg , the flake and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting . ' The cereal was delicious , but like the easter egg bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble . ' Ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare . My nine-year-old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' The easter feast is made of half a cadbury 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from israel ; toffee crisp cereal ; home-made brownie ; creme egg ; mini eggs ; flake ; dulce de leche ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and m & m 's .

        "question": "The number of women in britain becoming nuns is at a 25-year high . Figures from the catholic church show the number of women taking holy vows has trebled from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year . From a low of only seven in 2004 , the figure has been rising for the past decade . Theodora hawksley , 29 , was until recently a post-doctoral researcher in theology at the university of edinburgh . But at the beginning of the year she decided to become a nun . Figures from the catholic church show the number of women becoming nuns in britain has trebled from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year . From a low of seven in 2004 , the figure has been rising for the past decade ( file image ) . She joined the congregation of jesus in january and is now living in their house in willesden , north london , while taking the first steps towards making vows of poverty , chastity and obedience . Miss hawksley , from hertfordshire , said : â in one sense , it is a bit like trying to explain to somebody why you are marrying the person you are . You can list their qualities , but in the end it is a relationship of love . â but on the other hand , i was drawn to it by wanting a greater freedom in being able to give myself to god and the world . ' I don â t have to worry now about practical things like making a career for myself . I â m free to go where i â m needed and meet people at the margins . â she is not the only young woman choosing the religious life . According to church figures , 14 of the 45 women who entered convents last year were aged 30 or under . The next moderator of the free church has claimed the church of scotland is â literally dying â because of falling congregation numbers . The rev david robertson said the departure of ministers and â concerns â over issues such as same-sex marriage are linked to a â theological and moral decline â in the kirk . The dundee minister , who will become moderator next month , made the remarks on his blog site the wee flea as the church of scotland prepares to hold the general assembly 2015 in may . The free church has seen modest growth over six years , with about 13,000 people currently attending services . Mr robertson said the kirk is losing â around 16,000 members per year â . But the church of scotland yesterday hit back , saying it remains one of the country â s â largest and most robust organisations â . Miss hawksley said : â there is another person in an order in london and she is 27 and we meet to chat . You are not on your own . It is an unusual life choice , but you are not the only one making it . There are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions . â she admitted some of her friends were â a bit bewildered â , but most had been very supportive . Far from being trapped in traditional habits , miss hawksley said her order tends to dress down in t-shirts and jeans . Father christopher jamison , director of the national office for vocation of england and wales , said : â there is a gap in the market for meaning in our culture . One of the ways women may find that meaning is through religious life . â sister cathy jones , religious life vocations promoter at the office , said : â we are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago , catholic culture was at a very different place . â but the fact that more women are becoming nuns than in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner . â last year , bbc northern ireland political reporter martina purdy quit her 25-year career in journalism to become a nun . She said : â i know many people will not understand this decision . It is a decision i have not come to lightly , but it is one i make with love and great joy . â",

        "question": "Justin rose will try to take a leaf out of rory mcilroy 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters . Rose arrived at augusta national having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the pga tour , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in masters history . ' I 'm really excited about the rest of the year now . It 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said rose , who was looking to become the first european player to win the us open and masters . Justin rose was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of rory mcilroy , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . ' I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well . ' You look at rory 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer ( winning the open , bridgestone invitational and us pga in the space of four weeks ) . I was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year . Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship . ' The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw . ' I was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday . I think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon . ' Rose began the final round four shots behind spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer . ' There 's two ways to look at it . You can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added . Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his augusta form . Rose ( left ) congratulates tournament winner spieth and praised his performance level for the week . ' But you 've got to play it on the day , too . I felt like there were a few moments out there where i could have done better and i 'll learn on that and think about that . ' Jordan did n't really open the door and i did n't really expect him to . Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . I felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two-shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really . '",

        "question": "Bulgaria might not be the first hotspot that springs to mind for a summer holiday â but that could change after it was named europe 's cheapest destination yesterday . The former soviet state has gained the most from the strong pound , which has cut the cost of visiting the continent . Resorts on its black sea coast offer the best value in terms of a meal out , buying a cup of coffee and essentials such as sun cream and a cold drink , according to a study . Scroll down for video . Affordable : bulgaria has been named europe 's cheapest destination , with black sea resorts like sunny beach ( pictured ) offering the best value in terms of a meal out and other holiday activities . Hotspot : bulgaria 's most popular resort of sunny beach is a carbon copy of those of spain and greece . It is one of 13 european hotspots out of 14 where your cash will go far further this summer , largely thanks to rock-bottom exchange rates and higher inflation in some countries . Research into an imaginary shopping basket of ten typical holiday purchases showed a total price of Â£37.39 for bulgaria , which is down by 13.6 per cent from last summer . There was a bigger fall of 22 per cent for the algarve in portugal , taking the total cost to Â£44.02 , helping it beat spain 's costa del sol to become the second cheapest destination . Only in turkey , where inflation is 7.6 per cent â compared to virtually zero in britain and the eurozone â will britons find the cost of a day out much more expensive . The figures , compiled for the annual post office holiday costs barometer , show the spending basket in turkey is up by 21.4 per cent on last year , at Â£65.70 . Bulgaria 's most popular resort of sunny beach is a carbon copy of those of spain and greece .

The research is good news for travellers to the algarve , which offers good-value restaurants , with a three-course meal for two including wine costing just Â£16.42 , while a coffee will set you back 52p . At the other end of the scale , sorrento in southern italy is the dearest resort . Its basket costs Â£101.60 â almost three times bulgaria 's .

        "question": "Former sunderland defender danny higginbotham has described a controversial speech made by roy keane which he calls ' one of the most bizarre team talks i 've ever experienced ' . Higginbotham and his black cats team-mates were about to take on aston villa during the 2007-08 premier league season when keane sat them down in the home changing room at the stadium of light . But instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them , the former manchester united midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk . Republic of ireland assistant manager roy keane ( left ) looks frustrated during his country 's draw with poland . Keane watches his sunderland players in action against aston villa after delivering his ' bizarre ' team talk . Danny higginbotham ( right ) gave struggling sunderland the lead during the game on december 15 , 2007 . In his new autobiography rise of the underdog : my life inside football , higginbotham - who scored in sunderland 's 1-1 draw with villa that day - describes keane 's attempt to motivate his players . ' '' listen lads , ' he said . ' Basically you 're s*** . Try and enjoy the game . You 're probably going to get beat . But just enjoy being s*** . `` ' then he just walked out . Those words have got to be insulting to any professional , no matter who they come from , and i 'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong . I scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time . We ended up drawing . ' Higginbotham also reveals how keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them . Aston villa winger shaun maloney ( right ) scored a free-kick to secure a 1-1 draw for the visitors . Keane is now part of martin o'neill 's backroom staff after leaving his role at aston villa earlier this season . Higginbotham ( right ) , pictured in action against manchester city , played under keane for a season . Referring to a talk with keane , higginbotham writes : ' `` danny , all i 'm f****** hearing from you when i 'm watching that game yesterday is f****** encouragement . That 's all i 'm hearing . `` I thought , well , that 's not so bad . `` i do n't f****** want that . I want you to tell some of them they 're being c**** . Tell them . `` ' despite a 2-0 loss away at bolton in the season 's penultimate game , sunderland secured their premier league safety with a match to spare . But although he had helped ensure another year in england 's top-flight , keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against gary megson 's side . Higginbotham ( left ) now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in january , 2014 . Reliving his manager 's post-match team talk , higginbotham writes : ' `` you 're the reason i 'm driving up and down the f****** country to find another player , you 're not f****** good enough , `` he yells at one player . ' '' your attitude is s*** . You 're not good enough , `` he bawls at others . ' '' next week we 've got our last home game , against arsenal . You know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch , thank the fans for their support ? I 'm ringing umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers , because you 're a f****** embarrassment , it 's a joke and this is not going to stay this way . `` '",

        "question": "The name gary - once one of the most popular name in britain - is now heading for extinction . Just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows . That compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain . In 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 . All in a name : others suggest that gary lineker , left , or take that singer barlow might have put some off . Helped by the popularity of actor gary cooper , there was a surge in garys born in the us in the early 1950s . There was even a trend of girls being given the name . The name peaked in britain roughly decade later . In 1964 , it was ranked 16th most popular . Since then , there has been a fall in the number of garys . It is now among a number of once-common names that are close to dying-out completely . Fall from grace : some blame shamed pop star gary glitter , pictured , for the name 's declining popularity . There has been suggestion that football pundit lineker , or take that singer barlow might have put some off the name . But others point to britain 's most notorious gary , paedophile pop star glitter , who was jailed for 16 years for a string of sex attacks on girls , as the reason behind the name 's fall from grace . Speaking to the sun , gary davis , from south london , said : ' gary glitter has obviously done us no favours . ' Between 1996 and 2013 , unusual names such as dexter ( there were 1,019 born in 2013 ) , jenson ( 1,055 ) and harley ( 1,275 ) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100 . Meanwhile , the country went from having no girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . Nearly 200 were born in 2013 . Other names inspired by famous faces including rihanna ( 60 born in 2013 ) , hermione ( 77 ) and paris ( 107 ) were also more popular than humble gary . Data from last year shows a surge in arabic names in the uk , with omar , ali and ibrahim all entering the boys â top 100 for the first time . For girls , maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35 , while nur is a new entry in the girls â top 100 , jumping straight to number 29 . And muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys . Sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year â s biggest riser within the girls â top 100 was maryam , while the highest new entries were nur , emilia and gracie . For baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . The highest new entry was kian . Popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . Above , harper with her brothers and father last month . Girls . Alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it â s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . Not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . It dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . Barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . Barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . Claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . Claudine along with most other once-popular âine and âeen-ending girls â names are now out of favor . Nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . But today , most parents say no to nanette . Sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . Sondra - sandra â s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . But the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . Thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name â she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet â is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . Zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . Selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . Boys . Elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . Any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . Icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . His name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . Inigo - inigo is another name that â s never ranked here , though it â s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . It â s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . Llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . But despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . Remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . But the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . Sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson â s heyday , but it hasn â t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . Waldo - where â s waldo ? He â s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . Waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .",

        "question": "For most people , spotting a google street view car is an interesting , if uneventful , point in the day . But for nasr bitar , it was his time to shine . The college student spotted the car on the streets of mississauga , canada , last autumn and began following in his own vehicle . His plan ?

Tracked : it was the first time nasr had seen a street view car , and he followed it in his own vehicle . Having figured out the pattern the street view car was following , nasr parked his car , jumped out and got in position - just in time to take the snap . He told petapixel.com : ' i was driving home when i saw the google car drive towards me . ' I had never seen one before , and it took me a few minutes to realize that it is google car and it was time to shine . ' But then came the wait to see if he would make it onto the site . So , imagine nasr 's delight when he realised street view had been updated - and he could be seen proudly taking his selfie .

        "question": "( cnn ) on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? That 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! I shot him . I 'm sorry , `` bates said in a video of the shooting . But it 's happened before . In a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . The former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? Here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . So if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . Bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , `` bates said in a written statement to investigators . After bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , `` said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , `` brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . `` Brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . In his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher `` to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . Bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled `` by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , `` he told investigators . Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . If convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . Deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . Bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . Attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . One held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , `` said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . Taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . Some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . But all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . Sgt . Jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim `` of something called `` slip and capture . `` That 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . But a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . `` `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , `` said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . `` An attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture `` theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , `` the attorney said . And that defense failed . Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . Steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . A taser has a different grip and feel . When you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . There 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . But in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . Taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . And its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! Taser ! Taser ! `` As they prepare to deploy it . These guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . It is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . The company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . The stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . Cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .",

        "question": "( cnn ) the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . Buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self-described reformers have been . Swath . But the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . And the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . For too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . The cancer of corruption has to be cut out . I visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . Abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . Soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . It 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . Yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . And when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . Graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . The richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . For a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . But stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . Lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . One was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . The problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . The problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . Nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . The south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . And the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . `` Westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . Failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . Previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . In 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . Few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . And soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . The government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . What is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . And the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . For buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . The victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . On the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . He ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . But he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . Buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . Now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . Get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . Buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . But they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . You can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .",

        "question": "Justin rose will try to take a leaf out of rory mcilroy 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters . Rose arrived at augusta national having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the pga tour , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in masters history . ' I 'm really excited about the rest of the year now . It 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said rose , who was looking to become the first european player to win the us open and masters . Justin rose was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of rory mcilroy , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . ' I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well . ' You look at rory 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer ( winning the open , bridgestone invitational and us pga in the space of four weeks ) . I was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year . Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship . ' The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw . ' I was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday . I think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon . ' Rose began the final round four shots behind spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer . ' There 's two ways to look at it . You can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added . Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his augusta form . Rose ( left ) congratulates tournament winner spieth and praised his performance level for the week . ' But you 've got to play it on the day , too . I felt like there were a few moments out there where i could have done better and i 'll learn on that and think about that . ' Jordan did n't really open the door and i did n't really expect him to . Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . I felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two-shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really . '",

        "question": "Residents living yards from the scene of the Â£60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . They also claim to have heard â drilling â noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : â my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . â but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . â but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : â it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . â career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : â we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . â i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? â former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . Kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . Mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . Where were the gang from ? Speculation over the gang â s origin has been feverish . Possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . However , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . An accomplice on the inside ? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . Furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company â s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . Loot smuggled out of the country ? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . Whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be â a doddle â . What about the â king of diamonds â ? A criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . The panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with Â£13million worth of jewellery .",

The research was carried out by michael sivak and brandon schoettle from the university of michigan transportation research institute . They asked more than 3,200 adults across the us , india , china , japan , great britain and australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle . More than a third of americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness , including reading , texting , watching movies or television , playing games or working . More than half of indians , 40 per cent of chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in japan , great britain and australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities .

        "question": "Armstrong , 26 , pleaded guilty of trying to bring a stun gun , a baton and knuckle dusters back into the uk from cyprus in his luggage ( file picture ) . A holidaymaker who jetted off to cyprus to celebrate his new job was sacked before starting after returning with a stun gun , baton and knuckle duster in his luggage . Paul armstrong , 26 , of sunderland , flew to cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an it project manager . But after a spending spree on the trip , armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch , extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage . A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to ' startle and repel ' . Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it . Judge john milford qc told newcastle crown court : ' the general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs . ' What he did was foolish . It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items . ' A stun gun is , within the legislation of this country , a firearm . It is an extremely serious offence to possess one . ' It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country . ' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment , suspended for two years , with Â£2,000 costs at newcastle crown court ( pictured ) . The judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in armstrong 's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons , had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment . Judge milford added : ' he had an extremely good job lined up . As a consequence of these proceedings , which he had to reveal to his perspective employers , he lost that job . ' As such , armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment , suspended for two years , with Â£2,000 costs . Glen gatland , defending , said ; ' he has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character . ' He went on holiday to cyprus with four friends ( in the summer of 2013 ) who had been to primary school together . ' The reason he went was because he had been offered a job as it project manager with retail branches in london and zurich . ' He would have been moving away and not able to see his friends . ' The court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage . Mr gatland said the weapons were bought from a ' corner shop ' in cyprus and armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases .",

        "question": "John helm was commentating on bradford city â s game against lincoln city when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day . Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze . It was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember . Approaching the 30th anniversary of the bradford city fire , it was inevitable i would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match i was commentating on for yorkshire television . What i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as martin fletcher has done with his book fifty-six , the story of the bradford fire . The tragic fire at bradford city 's valley parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind â any bitterness would be understandable â but from everything i have been told there isn â t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately . On the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started . Detective inspector raymond falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire . This corroborates what i was told at the time by the coroner . He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from australia , but his name was never revealed . Without making allegations against the club â s chairman at the time stafford heginbotham , there is inference by implication in the book â with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased heginbotham . As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson . I find it abhorrent that stafford heginbotham â s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives . There isn â t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy . It should also never be forgotten that heginbotham twice saved bradford city from extinction . As son james said to me : â he put that club above everything else , including family and business . â a memorial at valley parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine . I can not bear to watch the footage . If i hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded i have to leave the room . Many of the 54 bradford and two lincoln fans who lost their lives , choked to death with inhalation of fumes . The smell was of acrid tar . As a bradfordian myself i knew many of those fleeing for their lives , as i attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional . Thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .",

        "question": "Islamic state militants have released photographs which appear to show the beheading of an ' alleged blasphemer . ' A series of gruesome photographs show a man being led out of a van handcuffed and blindfolded before he is executed by a masked man , wielding a meat cleaver . His beheading is believed to have taken place in hama in syria . Scroll down for video . A man was apparently beheaded by isis in hama , syria , for being an alleged ' blasphemer ' . The series of photos are the latest images released by the militant group which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters and spread fear among those working against isis in iraq and syria . In one of the images the victims is seen blindfolded and kneeling on the floor , surrounded by men with guns . An executioner , with his face covered , stands behind him with what appears to be a meat cleaver raised over his head . The next photo , which is too disturbing to publish , shows the man after he has been murdered with his severed head placed on his body . Each of the images are similar to videos released of british and american hostages who have also beheaded by the militants . A series of gruesome images show the man being led from a van in handcuffs and blindfolded . The man was forced to kneel down while blindfolded before he is apparently brutally executed . It follows a video released by isis which week that warns ' america will burn ' and threatens a repeat of the 9/11 atrocity that saw the twin towers destroyed . The 11-minute video features some of the group 's most brutal killings - such as the beheading of american journalist james foley and the brutal burning of jordanian pilot muadh al-kasasbeh as he stood in a cage . The twin towers and still images of osama bin laden are also shown during the short video . Militants armed with rifles surround the man , while his executioner stands behind holding a meat cleaver . Propaganda is increasingly being used by isis as a way of attracting new recruits and gaining notoriety . The latest photographs follow a video released last month which show eight suspected informers , all dressed in red jumpsuits , being executed . In january , isis militants threatened to behead barack obama and turn the us into a muslim province in another gruesome video that emerged from their self-styled caliphate .",

        "question": "( cnn ) two cnn heroes are among the earthquake survivors in kathmandu , nepal . And they are struggling in the aftermath . Anuradha koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls . While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed , all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks , followed by a second earthquake on may 12 . The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry . `` we are suffering with rain , strong wind . The fear is not gone from us . It is very , very hard , `` said koirala , the founder of the nonprofit maiti nepal and the 2010 cnn hero of the year . The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera . Koirala 's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food . Still , she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster . `` these girls are most vulnerable , because now people will target them , `` koirala said . `` they could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse . Maybe rape , maybe they will be trafficked , anything . ... if i get more support i will take as many as i can . `` About five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . Home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , `` koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . `` Koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , `` koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . I was not afraid that i was going to be killed . I was afraid about what is going to happen next . `` Another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . They are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . But mentally , we are , `` said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . Basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , `` basnet said . `` we are really scared . `` They also do n't have much water or food , basnet says . But she is trying to stay positive . `` i think for the time being , whatever we have , we should be happy , you know ? Because at least we have our life , `` she said . `` ( my kids ) all are safe . That 's the most important thing for me . `` Basnet 's `` butterfly home `` -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake . Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october . Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 hero of the year . `` when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , `` she said . `` i have to restart again . `` Still , basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid . To that end , several cnn heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in nepal . Jake wood 's disaster relief organization , team rubicon , has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in kathmandu . The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city . Six canine-firefighter search teams from the united states also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts . The teams were trained by wilma melville 's national disaster search dog foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers , hazmat experts and doctors . Tom henderson 's shelterbox , which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies , has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families . Dr. laura stachel 's group , we care solar , sent solar suitcases to health care workers , providing them with light and power as they aid survivors . Arlene samen 's group , one heart world-wide , has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies , especially in hard-hit districts . Robin lim , a disaster response midwife who founded bumi sehat , joined samen in kathmandu to help the mothers . Doc hendley 's nonprofit , wine to water , partnered with appalachian state university in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in nepal . The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly .",

At the event chevrolet also unveiled a new car in its malibu range , the bolt ev concept vehicle and the 2015 captiva . Self-driving cars may be a way to take your eyes off the road and relax a little , but they can also increase travel sickness , research has found . The research was carried out by michael sivak and brandon schoettle from the university of michigan transportation research institute . They asked more than 3,200 adults across the us , india , china , japan , great britain and australia what kinds of activities they would do instead of driving in a fully self-driving vehicle . More than a third of americans said they would do things that increase the likelihood and severity of motion sickness , including reading , texting , watching movies or television , playing games or working . More than half of indians , 40 per cent of chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in japan , great britain and australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities . The figures suggest that once autonomous vehicles become more mainstream as many as 12 per cent of people will feel ill in the vehicles at some point during a journey .

        "question": "A married couple who thought they would never be able to have children are celebrating after welcoming triplets - born three years apart thanks to ivf . Denise and glen higgs , from braunton , devon , had all but lost hope that they would ever be able to conceive after glen was made infertile due to cancer treatment . But using his frozen sperm , doctors successfully created eight embryos through ivf fertility treatment and the couple had a daughter mazy , born three years ago . Louise and glen higgs with daughter mazy , aged three and newborns carson alan ( left ) and carter joel ( right ) . The couple tried again using the same batch and denise gave birth to twins carter and carson last week . Former raf fireman glen said : ' medical staff have told us our three children are triplets as they are all from the batch of embryos that were created at the same time . ' It is crazy really - seeing as there are three-and-half years between them in age . ' Glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . He met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment . Carter joel higgs ( white top ) and carson alan higgs ( blue top ) who were born on march 24 2015 weighing 5lb 12oz and 5lb 5oz , with ivf triplet sister mazy linda higgs , aged three . Glen said : ' i had an unusual tumour growing within the testicle . After all my treatment , they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers . ' I knew then that if i ever wanted to have children i would have to go through ivf . ' I had always wanted kids and first went through the process with dee in 2010 . We got funding for the first try and got lucky when mazy was born . ' Glen , now a manager at a filter-making factory , said : ' we then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay . We ended up having eight embryos . ' We put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six . ' We were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again . We had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again . ' Amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies . ' I always wanted to have kids and am a big family man . The process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome . ' I am the happiest man ever . I have three healthy kids when i thought i would never have any . One we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift . ' What my wife and her body had to go through makes her the real hero to me . ' Glen , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile . He met dee and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of ivf treatment : carter joel higgs ( white top ) and carson alan higgs ( blue top ) . The ivf procedure involved doctors effectively ' hoovering ' the eggs from of dee 's body and injecting them with the frozen sperm . Care assistant denise , 27 , said : ' when i heard i was having twins i cried and my husband just went white . To now have triplets is simply amazing . In the uk , one in every three thousand births is to triplets . Approximately 15 per cent of ' multiples ' are born thanks to ivf . Source : twinsuk . ' We were so happy though . It has been a huge change in our lives but we have just learnt to adapt . ' Going through ivf is one of the hardest things you ever have to go through as a woman . ' The whole process is horrendous , but as we have proved it does actually work . ' There are so many injections and medication and it can be very undignified at times . I did get very emotional at times but i have no regrets at all about doing it . ' I could not be happier with what we have been left with . ' The couple have now disposed of the remaining embryos and have no plans to have any more children .",

        "question": "Residents living yards from the scene of the Â£60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . They also claim to have heard â drilling â noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : â my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . â but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . â but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : â it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . â career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : â we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . â i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? â former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . Kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . Mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . Where were the gang from ? Speculation over the gang â s origin has been feverish . Possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . However , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . An accomplice on the inside ? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . Furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company â s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . Loot smuggled out of the country ? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . Whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be â a doddle â . What about the â king of diamonds â ? A criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . The panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with Â£13million worth of jewellery .",

        "question": "Saudi prince alwaleed bin talal has pledged to give 100 bentleys to saudi pilots who took part in air strikes against rebels advancing in yemen . A saudi prince has promised to give a free bentley to every pilot involved in the yemen air strikes , as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop . Saudi arabian forces launched air strikes on yemen a month ago to stop advances from the shiite houthi rebels , who are allied with iran and previously overthrew the saudi-backed government . Prince alwaleed bin talal , the saudi king abdullah 's nephew , has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in riyadh , the saudi arabian capital , a free bentley . Prince talal , who owns $ 300 million stake in twitter , apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted , the international business times reported . He wrote : ' to recognise the one hundred participating saudi pilots i am pleased to present them with 100 bentley cars , ' on tuesday the saudis said the bombing raids , which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480 , had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead . But the raids appeared to have resumed by wednesday , with fighting taking place in taez . Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed . Bin talal , 60 , is the grandson of saudi arabia 's founder ibn saud and one of the richest men ion the world . He has an estimated fortune of $ 23 billion and investments in london 's savoy hotel , apple , citigroup and news corp . He has previously gifted 25 bentleys to members of a saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world 's richest . Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by saudi arabian forces . The prince , who is a billionaire , has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a bentley . His comments were met with criticism on twitter , as well as supporters of those in yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes . Saudi forces began its military campaign , called operation decisive storm , on march 26 . They were launched to stop the advancement of shiite houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the saudi-backed government and ousted president abed rabbo mansour hadi . Saudi arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of sanaa would stop on tuesday , but they appeared to resume again on wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in yemen . After four weeks hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital sanai . The saudis announced yesterday an end to the ' successful ' operation decisive storm and that they would be moving to a new operation , dubbed ' restoring hope . ' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity . However the saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of aden as well as taez . In taez , the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th armoured brigade , loyal to hadi , an army officer said . The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports .",

        "question": "Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a ufo . The clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to youtube , prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life . Spine-chilling : the creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a ufo . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over shortandy for a quarter of an hour on saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed , no trace of it was left in the sky . Speaking to local news website today.kz , villager oleg menshikov said : ' it was like a black cloud . We saw it at around 4 pm on april 3 . It dissipated like smoke , but it was completely odourless . ' Within minutes of the video being shared online , youtube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft , while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky . Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst , which is caused by a falling mass of warm air . Mysterious : the clip was filmed on saturday in shortandy village , 40 miles north of the capital astana , and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly : confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over shortandy for a quarter of an hour on saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air . Speaking to russia today , andrey solodovnik - associate physics professor at the northern kazakhstan state university - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens . He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years , the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories . Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke , though these are usually lighter-coloured , considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes . In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind .",

The 62-year-old 's home has lived in a trailer park in connecticut every since the disaster where she met her partner dennis krauss , whose home in brooklyn , new york , was also destroyed . Dennis krauss and mary ann diano said they plan to spend their winning on a new house . Both of them were left homeless when hurricane sandy wrecked havoc on the east coast of the us in october 2012 . The loving couple met after they separately moved from new york to a trailer park in connecticut , after they lost their homes . During the storms ms diano had been swept away by the waves and clung to a tree for safety . The 62-year-old did n't evacuate during hurricane sandy because there was nowhere where she could bring her cats . She lost everything in the storm - but in its aftermath she met the love of her life and won the lottery . â sandy left me homeless and alone and now because of sandy i met the love of my life , i hit the lottery and we â re shopping for the house of our dreams â , the thrilled woman told the new york daily news after she won $ 255,555 ( Â£174,000 ) . Ms diano â s troubles first began when she stayed at home with her five cats during the storm brought on by hurricane sandy , which caused chaos when it hit 24 states in the us . As the water began to fill her house she stepped outside and was swept away by a huge wave before landing in the high branches of a tree â saying she feared she was going to die .

        "question": "A four-poster bed which was dumped in a hotel car park and sold for Â£2,200 has been verified as once belonging to king henry vii â and it could now be worth millions . The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester , by builders who were renovating the property . Oblivious to its true value and historical significance , the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers . The four-poster oak wood bed ( above ) , which was dumped in the car park of redland house hotel in chester and later sold at auction for Â£2,200 , has now been confirmed by dna as once belonging to king henry vii . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and , oblivious to its true value and historical significance , left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for Â£2,200 in 2010 by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland who spotted the item , which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival , on the internet . However , he was shocked when his new ' victorian ' purchase arrived and approached tv historian jonathan foyle with a suspicion that the bed was , in fact , the only surviving tudor bed . Since then , mr foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii . He said tests confirmed it was european oak and of a sub-species ' typical of the origin of the finest , slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites ' , with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age . ' Under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . He has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . Mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . Henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for Â£2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . Tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . The strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . The carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . Meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . Mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . The bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . The strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . Henry viii may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . It is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . Born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . Under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . Jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . It has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' He added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' Experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' Dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . He added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' Mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to Â£20million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . It is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . In 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . Meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . And last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . Henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .",

        "question": "( cnn ) the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . Buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self-described reformers have been . Swath . But the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . And the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . For too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . The cancer of corruption has to be cut out . I visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . Abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . Soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . It 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . Yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . And when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . Graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . The richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . For a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . But stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . Lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . One was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . The problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . The problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . Nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . The south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . And the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . `` Westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . Failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . Previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . In 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . Few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . And soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . The government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . What is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . And the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . For buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . The victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . On the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . He ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . But he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . Buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . Now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . Get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . Buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . But they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . You can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .",

        "question": "Islamic state militants have released photographs which appear to show the beheading of an ' alleged blasphemer . ' A series of gruesome photographs show a man being led out of a van handcuffed and blindfolded before he is executed by a masked man , wielding a meat cleaver . His beheading is believed to have taken place in hama in syria . Scroll down for video . A man was apparently beheaded by isis in hama , syria , for being an alleged ' blasphemer ' . The series of photos are the latest images released by the militant group which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters and spread fear among those working against isis in iraq and syria . In one of the images the victims is seen blindfolded and kneeling on the floor , surrounded by men with guns . An executioner , with his face covered , stands behind him with what appears to be a meat cleaver raised over his head . The next photo , which is too disturbing to publish , shows the man after he has been murdered with his severed head placed on his body . Each of the images are similar to videos released of british and american hostages who have also beheaded by the militants . A series of gruesome images show the man being led from a van in handcuffs and blindfolded . The man was forced to kneel down while blindfolded before he is apparently brutally executed . It follows a video released by isis which week that warns ' america will burn ' and threatens a repeat of the 9/11 atrocity that saw the twin towers destroyed . The 11-minute video features some of the group 's most brutal killings - such as the beheading of american journalist james foley and the brutal burning of jordanian pilot muadh al-kasasbeh as he stood in a cage . The twin towers and still images of osama bin laden are also shown during the short video . Militants armed with rifles surround the man , while his executioner stands behind holding a meat cleaver . Propaganda is increasingly being used by isis as a way of attracting new recruits and gaining notoriety . The latest photographs follow a video released last month which show eight suspected informers , all dressed in red jumpsuits , being executed . In january , isis militants threatened to behead barack obama and turn the us into a muslim province in another gruesome video that emerged from their self-styled caliphate .",
