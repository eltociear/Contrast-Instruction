        "query": "Liverpool manager brendan rodgers has written off manchester city ’ s chances of signing raheem sterling this summer by declaring the anfield club are bigger than their etihad rivals and making it clear they have no intention of becoming their feeder team . Ahead of sunday 's fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley , rodgers indicated it could take two decades for sheik mansour ’ s club to reach the status of either liverpool or manchester united . City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for sterling , who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal . The champions have also monitored vice-captain jordan henderson , who only has a season left on his anfield contract . Brendan rodgers says that a move to manchester city would not be step up for raheem sterling . Rodgers talks to sterling during friday 's training session ahead of fa cup semi-final against aston villa . However , rodgers was emphatic that moving to city would not represent a step up . ‘ if you say that city is a bigger club than liverpool , you ’ re wrong , ’ he said . ‘ i ’ ve got big respect for what city are doing — they ’ re trying to build it the right way . But at this moment you can ’ t compare the size of the two clubs . ‘ you ’ ve got liverpool and united , the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years . I wouldn ’ t say we were a development ground for going to “ bigger ” clubs . ’ city have tried to sign players from arsenal and liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals . They have bought gael clichy , emmanuel adebayor , bacary sagna and kolo toure from arsenal but failed to lure fernando torres when he was at anfield . Sterling is wanted by manchester city this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of liverpool 's leading lights and was nominated for pfa young player of the year . This summer , liverpool will also try to sign james milner from city . Rodgers hopes victory over villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players . ‘ our vision is to win trophies , ’ he said . ‘ the first objective was to get into the champions league again . We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy . We just have to concentrate on performance levels , get to the final and we ’ ll take it from there . ’ club captain steven gerrard is available after a three-match ban and rodgers has to decide whether to start with him in what could be his final appearance at wembley before his move to la galaxy . Rodgers is set to welcome steven gerrard back into the squad after his three-match suspension .",
        "retrieval": "With the premier league season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window . Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from . Here are best players who are currently set to leave their premier league clubs on a free in june . Manchester city 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - gerhard tremmel ( swansea ) . At 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side . Tremmel has played second fiddle to michel vorm and then lukasz fabianski during his four years at swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the swans beat bradford in the capital one cup final two years ago . Swansea 's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - glen johnson ( liverpool ) . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup is still a regular for liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at anfield this summer . Johnson , who has 54 england caps , is on a bumper deal at the merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - kolo toure ( liverpool ) . Another regular at liverpool who is still to extend his contract . Toure kept cristiano ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when real madrid came to anfield in november , but the 34-year-old ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club . Inconsistency has been kolo toure 's curse - the 34-year-old ivorian has produced some howlers at liverpool . Centre-back - ron vlaar ( aston villa ) . Vlaar performed so well at the world cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when thiago silva was selected ahead of him . Injury has restricted the dutchman to 16 appearances for villa this season . At 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams . Holland 's ron vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the world cup but could leave aston villa . Left-back - luke garbutt ( everton ) . Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper . The 21-year-old has played nine times for everton this year and faces a big battle to displace leighton baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere . Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old luke garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit . Right wing - james milner ( manchester city ) . Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer , milner has 15 years ' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 england caps . Milner is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday . Milner has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 england caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - mikel arteta ( arsenal ) . Named arsenal captain last summer , but arteta has not played for the gunners since november due to injury . Hard to see him displacing the in-form francis coquelin on his return . May be 33 , but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist . Mikel arteta has n't played for arsenal since november due to injury and will need to displace francis coquelin . Central midfield - tom cleverley ( manchester united ) . Named captain for a tour match against roma last summer , cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new united manager louis van gaal . ' I think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said . But alas , that did not prove to be the case . The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to aston villa , where he has played 30 times . He is not wanted back at united . Villa and everton are keen to sign the england international . Unwanted by manchester united , aston villa and everton want to sign england international tom cleverley . Left wing - jonas gutierrez ( newcastle ) . Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club . Will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him . Testicular cancer survivor jonas gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't newcastle . Striker - danny ings ( burnley ) . One of a number of young english strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for burnley this season . Rumoured to be of interest to manchester united and their neighbours city , as well as david moyes ' real sociedad . Manchester united and city are said to be interested in burnley 's dangerous striker danny ings . Striker - james wilson ( manchester united ) . Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under ryan giggs against hull . The 19-year-old has played 16 times under van gaal , but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close , the united academy product is yet to agree terms . James wilson , 19 , has played 16 times under louis van gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .",

        "query": "Residents living yards from the scene of the £60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ' peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime . They also claim to have heard ‘ drilling ’ noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks . Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ' greedy ' . Scroll down for video . Arrival : two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building . Leaving the area : later on , they exit the building with wheelies bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot . Scotland yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on good friday , but it was graded as ' no police response was deemed to be required ' . Residents on greville street - near the scene close to farringdon station - say they had suspicious power outages a full week before the heist , which they now think could be linked . Farhana begum , 19 , who lives in a flat just a ten-second walk from the raided premises , added : ‘ my mum actually heard drilling on the [ good ] friday night , it was probably about 9pm or 9.30pm . ‘ but there had been road works , or construction work , going on in the street for the last couple of weeks , so she thought that they may have been working late . Protection : one of the gang members carries a large plastic bag past the camera to help obscure his face . Vehicle : a white transit van used to transport the gang and their loot pulls away from outside the building . ‘ but she did think it was quite weird that they would be drilling at that time . Also , about two weeks ago , so the weekend before it happened , there was an electrical cut . ' Miss begum added : ‘ it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . It happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . ’ career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . Another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : ‘ we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . It was late at night on the friday or saturday . I ca n't remember which . ‘ i heard some type of noise . I 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . But i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? ’ former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . Mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . On saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . The pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . Described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . But one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . Saturday , march 28 . Thursday , april 2 . Friday , april 3 . Saturday , april 4 . Sunday , april 5 . Tuesday , april 7 . Mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . Instead he 's come back for more . ' I do n't think this was part of the plan . But criminals are greedy . ' Mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . Cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . It is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . The footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . At 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . A street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . The men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . It is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . On good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . The van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . At 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . From 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . They then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . In total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . Possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . Scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . A police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' He added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally . It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' In response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . Meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . Kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . The 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . Mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . Where were the gang from ? Speculation over the gang ’ s origin has been feverish . Possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . However , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . An accomplice on the inside ? The men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . Furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company ’ s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . Another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . Loot smuggled out of the country ? Some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . Whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . According to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be ‘ a doddle ’ . What about the ‘ king of diamonds ’ ? A criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . The only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . The panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . He and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with £13million worth of jewellery .",

A florida man wanted as a suspect in the murder of his own mother has been on the run from police since saturday . Police say michael scott shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son on the same day mother sandra shemansky , 57 , was found dead at the home they shared in winter garden . The body was discovered at the west colonial drive home when an out-of-state family member called in a well-being check . Wkmg reports that an initial investigation determined there was foul play . ' My biggest concern is that he might come back , ' said neighbor natalie randall , a resident of the winter garden rv resort . An attorney for his estranged wife confirmed shemansky 's failure to appear for the scheduled visit . He is already on parole for battery on law enforcement , has a history of bipolar mental illness , and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for an attempted suicide . His mother was there to help him as he went through a divorce . His wife filed a domestic violence injunction against him two years ago , according to her attorney , diana knowles dunlop . Neighbors said his mother may have been the one preventing him from making the meeting with his son . Neighbors at the winter garden rv resort believe divorce proceedings may have pushed shemansky over the edge . ' His mom would n't allow him to go , ' nathan tanner told reporters . ' She said because she did n't want him to have no more trouble through the courts . ' Tanner added the stress of the divorce proceedings may have pushed him over the edge . ' And he got some paperwork friday that was , i guess , bad news and i guess that triggered him , ' tanner told wftv . Authorities have the murder weapon , still not publicly identified , but will not yet confirm how sandra shemansky was killed , according to information given to local press by police lt. scott allen . He allegedly was seen going into the trailer park 's office and asking for a glass of water shortly after the murder . Shemansky was last seen fleeing on foot without any sort of provisions and no medication . His estranged wife is reportedly preparing to protect himself on the chance he arrives at her home . Anyone with information as to his whereabouts is urged to contact authorities at 407-656-3636 .",

        "retrieval": "Andrew flintoff fears kevin pietersen is ' running out of time ' to resurrect his england career . Flintoff , speaking at the england and wales cricket board 's natwest t20 launch , sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for ' probably the premier tournament ' in this country . The dual ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced , however , about pietersen 's prospects of forcing his way back into test contention . Kevin pietersen scored 170 for surrey in the parks as he bids to earn a recall to the england squad . Former england star andrew flintoff thiks time is running out for pietersen to resurrect his england career . Pietersen already has three ashes series wins on his cv but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins , and flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side . The controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after alastair cook 's team were whitewashed 5-0 in australia , but has taken heart from incoming ecb chairman colin graves ' hints that there may be a way back after all . Pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the ' clean slate ' being presented to him , and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against mccu oxford in his first red-ball innings for surrey since june 2013 . Flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for pietersen . ' He 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . England have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . Pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . It is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' Which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! `` For kevin to come in ? ' Flintoff said . ' I just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' If he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' That 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' Flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' Alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' He 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' Peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' The former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . England , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' I think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' In australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' With england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' It 's about time we started talking them up . I think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' It 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' He is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . Flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . Flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . It 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' We 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' I played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' You turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' Anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' We do n't really focus on what we 've got . Flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' I did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' Whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' I 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' The one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' I do n't see failing as a problem . But i see not having a go as a crime . ' So i thought `` i 'm going to have a go `` , and i certainly loved it . '",

        "query": "Their chipotle lunch became a media storm . But that was just the start for hillary clinton 's most trusted aide huma abedin . And so , relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off , the notoriously low-profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in new york - with another mexican bite . The 38-year-old was spotted with her husband , disgraced former congressman anthony weiner , and two-year-old son jordan tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on saturday afternoon . Scroll down for video . Before the campaign heats up : hillary clinton 's aide huma abedin ( left ) was spotted grabbing a mexican lunch with husband anthony weiner and three-year-old son jordan at quaint tortaria in new york on saturday . Low profile : weiner ( second left ) and adebin wore baseball caps as they enjoyed their lunch with their son . Weiner had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion . Skipping chipotle : their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food mexican diner . Abedin and clinton were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an iowa chipotle this week but came under fire after staff complained abedin did not put any change in the tip jar . Chipotle does not always have tip jars . The family was pictured inside at a table , where weiner swung his new york mets baseball cap backwards while he ate . It is just a few days after abedin and clinton were spotted , sunglasses on , in an iowa branch of fast food favorite chipotle . Grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad , the pair dashed back out to the ' scooby van ' - and failed to pay a tip . This time , with her boss out of sight , abedin side-stepped chipotle and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door : tortaría . Weiner and abedin both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off union square , where tortas range from $ 7.50 to $ 11 . As well as food served at the table , customers can also buymexican fare to use at home . Weiner , a former congressman , fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over twitter . He ordered the family 's food as his wife sat with headphones in listening to a conference call . Abedin 's husband weiner is the disgraced former congressman who was caught sending explicit images to women over twitter 's private message system . The couple stayed together throughout the saga in 2011 . The family will no doubt have to ride out more storms with fierce republican campaigns against hillary . Classy : the restaurant also doubles as a bodega , selling mexican-inspired pantry staples . Keen to get going : abedin looks back as weiener brings up the rear , holding his son 's scooter and helmet in one hand . It was a quiet and relaxed day for the family as they embark on a doubtless hectic journey toward the 2016 election . Rand paul quipped on saturday that the clinton campaign will require two planes wherever they go - ' one for her entourage , and one for her baggage ' . ' I 'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering , ' paul said . Opinions were divided over whether the former secretary of state nailed her attempt to woo middle america with her tour of iowa . Not the only one with a taste for mexican : marco rubio also dipped into chipotle for lunch the other day . In a bid to win over the everyman , she met with voters and laid out her vision for a campaign to be a champion for the average american . And , of course , visited chipotle . Clinton is not the only presidential hopeful who has been seen tucking into mexican fast food on the trail as they each try to court hispanic and low-income voters . Republican hopeful marco rubio has also grabbed a chipotle lunch . Jeb bush , however , admits that is not on his to-do list - as he and his colombian wife cook ' authentic ' mexican food at home .",

Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from . Here are best players who are currently set to leave their premier league clubs on a free in june . Manchester city 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - gerhard tremmel ( swansea ) . At 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side . Tremmel has played second fiddle to michel vorm and then lukasz fabianski during his four years at swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the swans beat bradford in the capital one cup final two years ago . Swansea 's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - glen johnson ( liverpool ) . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup is still a regular for liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at anfield this summer . Johnson , who has 54 england caps , is on a bumper deal at the merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - kolo toure ( liverpool ) . Another regular at liverpool who is still to extend his contract . Toure kept cristiano ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when real madrid came to anfield in november , but the 34-year-old ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club . Inconsistency has been kolo toure 's curse - the 34-year-old ivorian has produced some howlers at liverpool . Centre-back - ron vlaar ( aston villa ) . Vlaar performed so well at the world cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when thiago silva was selected ahead of him . Injury has restricted the dutchman to 16 appearances for villa this season . At 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams . Holland 's ron vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the world cup but could leave aston villa . Left-back - luke garbutt ( everton ) . Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper . The 21-year-old has played nine times for everton this year and faces a big battle to displace leighton baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere . Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old luke garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit . Right wing - james milner ( manchester city ) . Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer , milner has 15 years ' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 england caps . Milner is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday . Milner has 15 years in top flight experience , 53 england caps and still is n't 30 , so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - mikel arteta ( arsenal ) . Named arsenal captain last summer , but arteta has not played for the gunners since november due to injury . Hard to see him displacing the in-form francis coquelin on his return . May be 33 , but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist . Mikel arteta has n't played for arsenal since november due to injury and will need to displace francis coquelin . Central midfield - tom cleverley ( manchester united ) . Named captain for a tour match against roma last summer , cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new united manager louis van gaal . ' I think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said . But alas , that did not prove to be the case . The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to aston villa , where he has played 30 times . He is not wanted back at united . Villa and everton are keen to sign the england international . Unwanted by manchester united , aston villa and everton want to sign england international tom cleverley . Left wing - jonas gutierrez ( newcastle ) . Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club . Will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him . Testicular cancer survivor jonas gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't newcastle . Striker - danny ings ( burnley ) . One of a number of young english strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for burnley this season . Rumoured to be of interest to manchester united and their neighbours city , as well as david moyes ' real sociedad . Manchester united and city are said to be interested in burnley 's dangerous striker danny ings . Striker - james wilson ( manchester united ) . Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under ryan giggs against hull . The 19-year-old has played 16 times under van gaal , but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close , the united academy product is yet to agree terms . James wilson , 19 , has played 16 times under louis van gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .",
        "retrieval": "Liverpool manager brendan rodgers has written off manchester city ’ s chances of signing raheem sterling this summer by declaring the anfield club are bigger than their etihad rivals and making it clear they have no intention of becoming their feeder team . Ahead of sunday 's fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley , rodgers indicated it could take two decades for sheik mansour ’ s club to reach the status of either liverpool or manchester united . City have been heavily linked with a £50million move for sterling , who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal . The champions have also monitored vice-captain jordan henderson , who only has a season left on his anfield contract . Brendan rodgers says that a move to manchester city would not be step up for raheem sterling . Rodgers talks to sterling during friday 's training session ahead of fa cup semi-final against aston villa . However , rodgers was emphatic that moving to city would not represent a step up . ‘ if you say that city is a bigger club than liverpool , you ’ re wrong , ’ he said . ‘ i ’ ve got big respect for what city are doing — they ’ re trying to build it the right way . But at this moment you can ’ t compare the size of the two clubs . ‘ you ’ ve got liverpool and united , the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years . I wouldn ’ t say we were a development ground for going to “ bigger ” clubs . ’ city have tried to sign players from arsenal and liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals . They have bought gael clichy , emmanuel adebayor , bacary sagna and kolo toure from arsenal but failed to lure fernando torres when he was at anfield . Sterling is wanted by manchester city this summer for £50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of liverpool 's leading lights and was nominated for pfa young player of the year . This summer , liverpool will also try to sign james milner from city . Rodgers hopes victory over villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players . ‘ our vision is to win trophies , ’ he said . ‘ the first objective was to get into the champions league again . We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy . We just have to concentrate on performance levels , get to the final and we ’ ll take it from there . ’ club captain steven gerrard is available after a three-match ban and rodgers has to decide whether to start with him in what could be his final appearance at wembley before his move to la galaxy . Rodgers is set to welcome steven gerrard back into the squad after his three-match suspension .",

But the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . And the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . For too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . The cancer of corruption has to be cut out . I visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . Abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . Soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . It 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . Yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . And when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . Graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . The richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . For a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . But stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . Lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . One was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . The problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . The problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . Nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . The south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . And the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . `` Westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . Failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . Previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . In 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . Few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . And soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . The government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . What is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . And the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . For buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . The victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . On the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . He ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . But he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . Buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . Now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . Get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . Buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . But they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule .

' You look at rory 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer ( winning the open , bridgestone invitational and us pga in the space of four weeks ) .

' The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw .

I think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon .

Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . I felt that if i make my birdie putt and jordan misses for par , it 's a two-shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really . '",

Zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk ’ . She was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into huminski ’ s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the uk . Scroll down for video . On his way to britain : zbigniew huminski ( left ) , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe ( right ) , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk ’ . Horrifying : the little girl 's naked body was found in the woods near calais 90 minutes after she was taken . Chloe ’ s mother , named only as isabelle , ‘ heard her daughter ’ s screams ’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in calais - but was unable to do anything . Jean pierre valensi , the prosecutor of nearby boulogne-sur-mer , said huminski was arrested hours later and ‘ immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child . ’ dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘ strangulation and sexual violence ’ , said mr valensi . Tests also showed huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving . Huminski had been banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of ‘ extreme violence ’ including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife . But he had driven to france in a polish registered car this week , and intended to travel to britain to stay with family who had emigrated there , said mr valensi . Chloe was playing with a friend on wednesday afternoon when she approached huminski , who had stopped his car to drink a beer , and squirted him with her water pistol . Remembered : relatives of chloe are joined in a march in calais today following the nine-year-old girl 's death . Walking together : the mayor of calais natacha bouchart ( right ) and the mother ( centre ) of chloe , identified only as isabelle , leave calais city hill with relatives today . The pole later told french police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red seat toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby dubrulle wood . Isabelle , who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match , began screaming the moment she saw the man , described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses , pushing chloe into his car . The car , which had polish number plates , was found by police near where chloe was killed . Isabelle did not even have time to reach chloe 's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered . ' I 've begun to understand i will never see chloe again , ' isabelle told le parisien . ' It 's tough . Very hard . Above all , i do not know when or how i 'm going to tell his little sister and little brother . They are only five and four years old , i do not know if they can understand . ' Huminski , who is single , originally moved to france in the early 2000s , and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the foreign legion as a soldier . He was rejected because of his criminal background , and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in england . Huminski was on his way to southampton , where his sister lives , french prosecutors confirmed tonight . Flowers : ms bouchart ( left ) comforts isabelle ( right ) , as relatives and people gather during a march in calais . Emotional day : a person holds a portrait during a march in calais in homage to the nine-year-old girl . In 2009 he was lodging in calais with a bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home , tying her up , before running away with the equivalent of £50 in cash . Psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed huminiski as a ‘ chronic alcoholic ’ known for violent burglaries in both france and britain . He was last convicted in france in april 2010 , when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault , before being released early on march 27 , 2014 , when he was deported to warsaw . Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red seat toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday , the prosecutor said . The child ’ s body was found around two hours later , three miles away in the dubrulle wood . Sadness : women place flowers at a playground in the neighbourhood where chloe was taken yesterday . Distraught : today people laid flowers at the place where the girl was snatched by the polish man ( pictured ) . Until a few weeks ago , it was the site of a large immigrant camp , made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of england . Such camps are regularly razed by the french authorities , with the migrants moved on . Natacha bouchart , the calais mayor , said : ‘ i was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the chateaubriand area of calais , at around 3.30pm . A city security chief found an empty red car registered in poland in dubrulle wood , in the north of the city . ‘ he then called the police , who found the body of the girl in the woods . During the same patrol , they found the person who owned the vehicle , apparently a polish national . ’ the mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city , saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region . Tragic decision : chloe 's mother had let her continue playing in calais because it was nice outside . Shocking : prosecutor jean-pierre valensi ( pictured ) said forensic investigators reported evidence of ' strangulation and sexual violence ' , and that the polish man in question had admitted to the killing . The mother of a child who went to school with chloe told agence france-presse : ‘ it 's horrific . My son knew her , he did n't sleep last night . He knows he will never see her again . I ca n't even imagine what the parents are going through . ’ french prime minister manuel valls called for light to be shed on the suspect 's history , saying the family and community were ' deeply shocked ' by the murder . ' It is up to the legal system now to carry out the investigation and what we owe to the family is the whole truth , ' he said . Calais was plunged into mourning after the killing of the girl described as ' cheerful and full of life ' . Residents planned a march in memory of chloe today . Flags in the town were already being flown at half mast . Huminski will now be kept in custody pending a criminal trial for murder .",

Former portsmouth ace ciftci briefly levelled the scores at dens park when he slotted home a penalty after greg stewart had given the hosts the lead . The 23-year-old celebrated by trying to rile dundee no 1 bain , but his actions came back to haunt him as the dark blues earned all three points thanks to further goals from jake mcpake and paul heffernan . Dundee united striker nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain . Bain refuses to react as the turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at den park . Turkish forward ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . It was dundee 's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place , as united 's poor run of domestic form continued . In front of a sell-out crowd , dundee started well with midfielder jim mcalister trying his luck early on with a 25-yard snap-shot on his left-foot which radoslaw cierzniak in the visitor ’ s goal held . United 's reply was a sweeping move involving paul dixon and chris erskine who , in turn , fed ciftci - but his low shot was saved by scott bain . Jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . However , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . The home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . The lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . Chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . Up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . Dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . However , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . As the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . The tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . Dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . United attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . At the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . However , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . Dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . Skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . Mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . However , the hard work had already been done by the hosts - who were by far the better team on the night .",

        "query": "A sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped . Domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . In february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence . But today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . Sentence dropped : domenico rancadore ( right and left ) fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ' man of honour ' . Although his conviction remains intact , italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed . The case will still have to be heard by the italian supreme court , according to the crown prosecution service ( cps ) . Rancadore 's solicitor , karen todner said : ' yesterday the italian court of appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of domenico rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence . ' I am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' There has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' Ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . Once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . The italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . Domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . Rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . Although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . Known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . He was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . During protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . In his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' Before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . Rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . Before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . There was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . Extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . After two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' Mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' It transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' So certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request `` . ' Courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' It is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' Had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' Domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . Asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . Barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' There was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . Curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . One neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . She went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' The neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . A court sketch of domenico rancadore . Today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . Sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' They are very quiet . I would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . Also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . Groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . Most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . Only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . It has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than €10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . Politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . The american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' He 's very quiet . He always has been , even before it all blew up . They are a very quiet family . ' Federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' That is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' It gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' Mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . A cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' It is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' Until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' The cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . At the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .",

An indonesian mobile brigade police team , believed to be an execution team , were photographed being taken on a boat to nusakambangan island . A local television station broadcast a chilling re-enactment of how executions are carried out in indonesi . In following through with the killings , the indonesian government ignored agonised pleas for clemency from the prisoners ' families and australian and international officials . All eight death row prisoners refused to wear blindfolds , choosing instead to face their executioners . Mary jane fiesta veloso - the filipino drug mule who was the ninth convict sentenced to death - was spared after new information emerged about her case . As news filtered through to the nearby port of cilacap , supporters prayed and sung ' amazing grace ' . Bali nine supporters comfort each other at cilacap after the harrowing news came through . ' Today we lost myuran and andrew . ' Our sons , our brothers . ' In the 10 years since they were arrested , they did all they could to make amends , helping many others . ' They asked for mercy , but there was none . ' They were immensely grateful for all the support they received . ' We too , will be forever grateful . ' The chan and sukumaran families were staying together in a hotel in cilacap when the murders occurred . Some relatives who were on the island reportedly heard the deadly shots ringing out and ' became hysterical ' . A twitter account purporting to belong to chan 's brother , michael , tweeted : ' i have just lost a courageous brother to a flawed indonesian legal system . I miss you already rip my little brother . ' One of the pair 's lawyers , peter morrissey , told the nine network : ' it 's a very sad time.. the two boys are gone . ' They were beautiful blokes . It is really sad . ' We did have a good ( legal ) argument . We still have a good argument . We just do n't have anything to ( argue ) it for . ' We 'll all keep fighting the death penalty for sure but it 's not going to bring the boys back . ' One of the lawyers for the bali nine , todung mulya lubis , saw the loss of the young australian men as a personal failure . ' I failed . I lost , ' he wrote on social media . ' I am sorry ' .

Later , a silence fell over the area with only singing voices , music of amazing grace and prayers heard for the doomed bali nine duo . The australian government is expected to retaliate for wednesday 's executions , which prime minister tony abbott and foreign minister julie bishop had long lobbied against . Even in the final hours , officials were fighting the death penalty ruling . Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world . It ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013 . The country , which has now carried out 15 such executions in four months , has vowed to kill all of its 58 foreign drug convicts by the end of the year .",
        "retrieval": "Out of prison and free to stroll around ireland 's capital , this is the notorious ' black widow ' killer who murdered her husband . Catherine nevin was allowed out on day release on wednesday afternoon despite being jailed for life in april 2000 for arranging to having her publican husband tom shot dead . The 62-year-old was permitted to attend an addiction studies course and was pictured leaving mountjoy prison and making her way from dublin 's dochas centre to the oblates in the city 's inchicore suburb . Black widow catherine nevin leaving mountjoy prison as she walks to get a bus . An unsuspecting commuter sat next to her as she made her way through the city centre and to her course in the suburbs . Catherine and tom nevin on their wedding day . The 62-year-old was given life in prison for arranging to have her husband shot dead . She walked through the city centre to dorset street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course . Ireland 's most infamous woman prisoner went largely unnoticed as she took the bus unaccompanied after leaving prison - with an unsuspecting female commuter sitting down next to her - according the daily mirror . Catherine nevin leaving the central criminal court in dublin during her trial in 2000 . Dressed in jeans , a blue fleece top and a pair of black ugg boots , nevin took in sights she has n't seen since being jailed 15 years ago . She laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby applegreen garage before her course started . She failed last july to have her conviction overturned , though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent . Her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the justice minister . The course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed . Nevin 's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the mounttown community facility in dun laoghaire last october . While attending that course , run by the dun laoghaire rathdown drugs task force , she was always accompanied by prison warders . Completion of the course gives participants a fetac level 5 addiction studies certificate . It 's believed that as well as attending the course in inchicore , nevin has also been using facilities at maynooth university in co kildare and trinity college over the past few weeks . While in prison nevin has been keeping herself busy . She has a job in the jail library and likes to do makeovers on other inmates . It was revealed in july 2013 how scissor sister charlotte mulhall , who is serving life for murder , regarded her as a close friend in jail . Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate . Tom nevin was shot dead in the couple 's pub , jack white 's inn , in brittas bay , co wicklow , in march 1996 . His wife was also convicted of soliciting three men – gerry heapes , william mcclean and john jones – to kill him . Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate . Her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of ireland . The trial and media coverage of the case was dominated by an intense focus on nevin herself , forcing the judge to order a ban on all reporting of her clothing and appearance . No physical evidence linking her to horrific crime was ever discovered . Her conviction was based largely on the evidence of the three men she is alleged to have solicited . Nevin married galway-born tom in 1976 . Over the following years they built up a property portfolio , before in 1986 buying the landmark pub where tom was murdered . His death was initially investigated his death as a pub raid which had gone tragically wrong .

Muller , 25 , netted the fourth goal of bayern 's 6-1 demolition of porto in the second leg of the champions league quarter-final at the allianz arena to secure their place in the last four . It was the world cup winner 's 27th champions league goal , taking him past former bayern team-mate mario gomez and making him the highest-scoring german since the tournament took its current shape in 1992 . Thomas muller leads the celebrations with bayern munich supporters after the champions league win . The germany international uses a megaphone to stir up the fans that remained after the final whistle . Supporters responded to muller 's chants as they celebrated the win against porto on tuesday night . Muller lets out a cry as the supporters joined in behind him after bayern munich reached the last four . 1 . Thomas muller - 27 . 2 . Mario gomez - 26 . 3 . Michael ballack - 16 . 4 . Miroslav klose - 14 . 5 . Carsten jancker - 13 . It was a night to savour in bavaria as the home side blitzed their portuguese opposition , who had sprung a surprise in the first leg by inflicting a 3-1 defeat on the bundesliga champions . But five first-half goals by thiago alcantara , jerome boateng , robert lewandowski ( two ) and muller ensured bayern 's safe passage into the semi-final . And after the match the bayern players remained on the pitch for some time as they celebrated with supporters behind the goal . As the squad lined up linking arms in the penalty area muller scaled the fence to reach the first row of fans , and with a megaphone in hand stirred up a frenzy as he led the chants . The supporters followed before muller climbed down to join the rest of the team as they danced on the pitch while fans sung in celebration . The supporters look down at muller as he leads the celebrations after a convincing bayern win . Muller scored his 27th goal in the champions league during bayern 's 6-1 win at the allianz arena . The world cup winner 's deflected shot squirmed past the wrong-footed fabiano in the porto goal . After watching his side storm into the semi-final , bayern boss guardiola hailed his players for their first-half performance . ' It 's easy to love my players now , ' said guardiola . ' I am the coach of extraordinary players . I did n't expect such a first half . ' We can still play better , ' he added . ' We lost the ball here and there and we can improve on that . We had a few problems in the second half . ' They had only a few chances but you should never relax in the champions league . '",
        "retrieval": "With the premier league season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window . Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from . Here are best players who are currently set to leave their premier league clubs on a free in june . Manchester city 's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - gerhard tremmel ( swansea ) . At 36 years old , he is no spring chicken , but tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side . Tremmel has played second fiddle to michel vorm and then lukasz fabianski during his four years at swansea , but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the swans beat bradford in the capital one cup final two years ago . Swansea 's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - glen johnson ( liverpool ) . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup is still a regular for liverpool , but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at anfield this summer . Johnson , who has 54 england caps , is on a bumper deal at the merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books . England 's first-choice right-back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - kolo toure ( liverpool ) . Another regular at liverpool who is still to extend his contract . Toure kept cristiano ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when real madrid came to anfield in november , but the 34-year-old ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club . Inconsistency has been kolo toure 's curse - the 34-year-old ivorian has produced some howlers at liverpool . Centre-back - ron vlaar ( aston villa ) . Vlaar performed so well at the world cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows , especially when thiago silva was selected ahead of him . Injury has restricted the dutchman to 16 appearances for villa this season . At 30 , he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams . Holland 's ron vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the world cup but could leave aston villa . Left-back - luke garbutt ( everton ) . Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal , but he is yet to put pen to paper . The 21-year-old has played nine times for everton this year and faces a big battle to displace leighton baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere . Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old luke garbutt down for the long term but he 's yet to commit . Right wing - james milner ( manchester city ) . Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer , milner has 15 years ' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 england caps . Milner is both tenacious and creative , either in the centre of midfield or out wide , and he is still a year off his 30th birthday .

Zbigniew huminski , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk ’ . She was stripped naked and sexually assaulted and after being forced into huminski ’ s car and then driven to an isolated wood once used as a camp for illegal migrants bound for the uk . Scroll down for video . On his way to britain : zbigniew huminski ( left ) , 38 , has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim , identified by her first name of chloe ( right ) , yesterday afternoon in france ‘ while drunk ’ . Horrifying : the little girl 's naked body was found in the woods near calais 90 minutes after she was taken . Chloe ’ s mother , named only as isabelle , ‘ heard her daughter ’ s screams ’ as she was being taken away from outside her school in calais - but was unable to do anything . Jean pierre valensi , the prosecutor of nearby boulogne-sur-mer , said huminski was arrested hours later and ‘ immediately recognised his involvement in the murder of the child . ’ dna evidence corroborated by an autopsy revealed ‘ strangulation and sexual violence ’ , said mr valensi . Tests also showed huminski was over the alcohol limit for driving . Huminski had been banned from french territory after being convicted twice for acts of ‘ extreme violence ’ including attacking a frail pensioner with a knife . But he had driven to france in a polish registered car this week , and intended to travel to britain to stay with family who had emigrated there , said mr valensi . Chloe was playing with a friend on wednesday afternoon when she approached huminski , who had stopped his car to drink a beer , and squirted him with her water pistol .

Walking together : the mayor of calais natacha bouchart ( right ) and the mother ( centre ) of chloe , identified only as isabelle , leave calais city hill with relatives today . The pole later told french police that he grabbed her and forced her into his red seat toledo before driving her three miles to the nearby dubrulle wood . Isabelle , who had left briefly to take her son to a sports match , began screaming the moment she saw the man , described by witnesses as bald and wearing sunglasses , pushing chloe into his car . The car , which had polish number plates , was found by police near where chloe was killed . Isabelle did not even have time to reach chloe 's father so they could launch a formal missing persons appeal before her body was discovered . ' I 've begun to understand i will never see chloe again , ' isabelle told le parisien . ' It 's tough . Very hard . Above all , i do not know when or how i 'm going to tell his little sister and little brother . They are only five and four years old , i do not know if they can understand . ' Huminski , who is single , originally moved to france in the early 2000s , and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the foreign legion as a soldier . He was rejected because of his criminal background , and then said he wanted to go and live with his sister in england . Huminski was on his way to southampton , where his sister lives , french prosecutors confirmed tonight .

In 2009 he was lodging in calais with a bulgarian immigrant when he attacked a pensioner in her own home , tying her up , before running away with the equivalent of £50 in cash . Psychiatric reports presented in court portrayed huminiski as a ‘ chronic alcoholic ’ known for violent burglaries in both france and britain . He was last convicted in france in april 2010 , when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault , before being released early on march 27 , 2014 , when he was deported to warsaw . Chloe is said to have pointed a water pistol at huminski as part of a childish game before he bundled her into the back of his red seat toledo at about 3.30pm yesterday , the prosecutor said .

Until a few weeks ago , it was the site of a large immigrant camp , made up of mainly men trying to get aboard ferries sailing to the south coast of england . Such camps are regularly razed by the french authorities , with the migrants moved on . Natacha bouchart , the calais mayor , said : ‘ i was informed at 4.30pm that a young girl was abducted by a man in a red car as she left school in the chateaubriand area of calais , at around 3.30pm . A city security chief found an empty red car registered in poland in dubrulle wood , in the north of the city . ‘ he then called the police , who found the body of the girl in the woods . During the same patrol , they found the person who owned the vehicle , apparently a polish national . ’ the mayor has been at the forefront of a campaign to clear out all illegal migrants from her city , saying they are behind all kinds of crimes in the region . Tragic decision : chloe 's mother had let her continue playing in calais because it was nice outside . Shocking : prosecutor jean-pierre valensi ( pictured ) said forensic investigators reported evidence of ' strangulation and sexual violence ' , and that the polish man in question had admitted to the killing . The mother of a child who went to school with chloe told agence france-presse : ‘ it 's horrific . My son knew her , he did n't sleep last night . He knows he will never see her again . I ca n't even imagine what the parents are going through . ’ french prime minister manuel valls called for light to be shed on the suspect 's history , saying the family and community were ' deeply shocked ' by the murder .

Dundee united striker nadir ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper scott bain . Bain refuses to react as the turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at den park . Turkish forward ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . It was dundee 's first win in a derby for more than 10 years and breathed further momentum into their push for a top-six place , as united 's poor run of domestic form continued . In front of a sell-out crowd , dundee started well with midfielder jim mcalister trying his luck early on with a 25-yard snap-shot on his left-foot which radoslaw cierzniak in the visitor ’ s goal held . United 's reply was a sweeping move involving paul dixon and chris erskine who , in turn , fed ciftci - but his low shot was saved by scott bain . Jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . However , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . The home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . The lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . Chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot .

Dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby .

However , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . Dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory .
